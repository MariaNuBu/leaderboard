      "question": "You are training a deep learning model to classify images of different dog breeds. Your dataset consists of 10,000 images, with each breed represented in a roughly equal proportion.\n\nWhich answer best describes the impact of shuffling the dataset before splitting it into training, validation, and test sets?",
      "options": [
        "Shuffling the dataset will introduce unnecessary randomness and can lead to overfitting on the training set.",
        "Shuffling the dataset is only necessary for datasets with more than 20,000 values.",
        "Shuffling the dataset will ensure that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of dog breeds, leading to a more robust model.",
        "Shuffling the dataset is not necessary, because the equal representation of each breed in the overall dataset ensures that the split sets will have a similar distribution."
