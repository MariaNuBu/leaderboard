      "question": "You work for a non-profit organization that is building a machine learning model for a university. The university wants to predict whether scholarship applicants are likely to succeed in college if awarded a scholarship. However, only 20% of applicants typically get accepted to the scholarship program, while 80% are rejected. This means you have a significant class imbalance in your dataset. Which strategy would help address this imbalance in the training data?",
      "options": [
        "Randomly remove half of the dataset to restore balance.",
        "Oversample by increasing the number of minority examples in the training set by sampling with replacement.",
        "Use data augmentation of image rotation to modify existing positive examples.",
        "Undersample by decreasing the number of minority examples in the training set by randomly removing some."
