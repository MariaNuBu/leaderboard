      "question": "You are working on a machine learning project that involves processing highly sensitive data. To ensure the confidentiality of this data, you need to implement encryption. You decide to use an Amazon SageMaker feature to help encrypt your data. How can you use Amazon SageMaker to help encrypt your data at rest?",
      "options": [
        "There is no need to encrypt data at rest when dealing with ML workloads. You only need to secure data in transit.",
        "Upload the unencrypted data to Amazon S3 and let SageMaker encrypt it automatically before training the model.",
        "SageMaker does not have any features that you can use for encryption.",
        "When you create a SageMaker notebook instance, training job, or other SageMaker resource that involves the storage of data, you can specify that an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key be used for encrypting the data at rest."
