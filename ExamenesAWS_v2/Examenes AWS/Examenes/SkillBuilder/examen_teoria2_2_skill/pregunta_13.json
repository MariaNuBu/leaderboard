      "question": "A machine learning engineer at a media organization aims to deploy a machine learning model for predicting customer behavior on AWS. The model uses a custom algorithm developed in-house. To facilitate this, they plan to use the Amazon SageMaker container capabilities. Which container image should they use for a seamless deployment process?",
      "options": [
        "SageMaker pre-built deep learning framework containers because they can be deployed in just a few clicks.",
        "SageMaker Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) containers because they support bringing your own model and are ideal for regulatory compliance.",
        "SageMaker pre-built ML library containers because these include a wide range of essential ML libraries.",
        "Custom containers developed by the organization with the necessary dependencies and configurations."
