      "question": "A machine learning engineer is working on a project that involves training an image classification model using Amazon SageMaker. Their team has decided to use one of the SageMaker built-in algorithms for this task. What is a key advantage of using the SageMaker built-in algorithms?",
      "options": [
        "The engineer has complete control over the algorithm's source code and can modify it as needed.",
        "The engineer can choose the specific Docker container to be used for training.",
        "The algorithms support all data ingestion modes, including Pipe mode, File mode, and Fast File mode.",
        "The algorithms are optimized for performance and provide a managed infrastructure, which reduces overhead."
