      "question": "A data scientist is working on a machine learning project that requires integrating a pre-trained model from AWS Marketplace. Their team wants to ensure that the model is deployed efficiently and cost-effectively on Amazon SageMaker. They decide to deploy the pre-trained model from AWS Marketplace on SageMaker. Which step should they take?",
      "options": [
        "Create a custom Docker container with the pre-trained model and deploy it on SageMaker.",
        "Download the pre-trained model from AWS Marketplace and manually deploy it on an Amazon EC2 instance.",
        "Train a new model on SageMaker using the pre-trained model as a starting point.",
        "Subscribe to the pre-trained model on AWS Marketplace, and deploy it on SageMaker through a Jupyter notebook, a SageMaker SDK, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)."
