        "Conduct load testing on the application. Using different metrics, identify which metric value reliably corresponds to occurrences of model latency. Create a target tracking policy and use this metric as the target metric. Set the target value to a value lower than the value at which model latency occurs.",
        "Conduct load testing on the application. Select the EC2 instance type with CPU resources capable of handling the maximum amount of expected load.",
        "Conduct load testing on the application. Identify the level of CPUUtilization where model latency begins to occur. Create a target tracking auto scaling policy and select CPUUtilization as the target metric, and a target value less than the value where latency begins to occur.",
