A non-profit organization is gathering data to decide which type of fundraiser their patrons would like to attend. They decide to provide two options for patrons to share their preferences: an online survey and a hard-copy mailer. Some patrons plan to fill out both the online and hard-copy survey to make sure their preference is recorded.

Which data cleaning technique will BEST help the company retain unique data points for the most effective machine learning (ML) solution?

Reformatting the hard-copy mailer to contain only "Yes/No" answers

Inspecting the data for incorrectly entered dates

Identifying duplicate data from those who submitted both an online and hard-copy survey (Correct)

Checking the datasets for mistyped patron names


You are cleaning up a dataset that includes the body weights of patients at a medical clinic. A clinician tells you that they usually see adults, but children occasionally visit the clinic.

Which data measurement BEST provides the central tendencies of your data?

You would choose the mean, because the best measurement of data that might contain outliers is taking the average of all data entries.

You would choose the median, because the best measurement of data that might contain outliers is sorting the data and dividing the dataset at the middle variable. (Correct)

Because the data is numerical, you can use any method of measurement to find the average weight of a patient.

There is no measurement you can use to find central tendencies of data.




An apparel company is building a machine learning solution to determine which types of products are not selling well. They've collected data on how long products sit in inventory, but their dataset contains many missing values.

Which method is the most effective option for addressing missing values in the apparel company's dataset?

Inspecting the reason for the missed values, and dropping, leaving, or imputing data accordingly (Correct)

Dropping all the data that contains missing values

Manually imputing every missing value

Letting their ML algorithm replace the missing values



An automobile company wants to use a machine learning solution to determine how quickly their various sizes of vehicles reach their highest speeds. The vehicle sizes are compact, mid-size, and full-size.

Numerical

Nominal

Ordinal (Correct)

Binary


You are building a data repository for a beverage company. You are tasked with encoding the values of the various flavor combinations customers can choose when they create a custom beverage. There are hundreds of flavor options, so you have a lot of features in your dataset. 



Which encoding technique is the BEST option for this encoding task?

Any type of encoding technique will work in this situation.

You would choose label encoding, because it assigns a unique integer for each flavor option. (Correct)

You would choose one-hot encoding, because it works most effectively when there are a lot of features in your dataset.

Categorical encoding will not work for this machine learning solution.



An energy company wants to assess how often their customers have to replace their solar panels after their initial solar panel purchase. Their raw data includes the dates of first purchase, customer reviews, and dates of additional purchases.

How might this company use feature engineering to help the machine learning model understand the relationship between these features in their dataset?

This is not a good use case for feature engineering, because the data includes a text-based feature.

The company can use numeric feature engineering to extract information from the purchase dates, and they can use text feature engineering to extract information from the customer reviews. (Correct)

The company can only use numeric feature engineering to extract information from this dataset.

The company can only use text feature engineering to extract information from this dataset.

Which feature engineering technique is a good method for engineering this numeric feature before model training?

Take the log transform of the values to help normalize distribution. (Correct)

Leave the values unchanged.

Take the mean of all values.

Use one-hot encoding to sort the values.

The analyst wants to retain necessary information but reduce the number of features before training the model. Which feature selection technique should they use?

Feature splitting

Feature scaling

Principal component analysis (PCA) (Correct)

No need for feature selection

An aerospace engineering company is analyzing data from a recent rocket test flight. While reviewing the data, the analysts notice some duplicate timestamps for certain sensor readings and a few values that seem impossibly high or low.

Which option is the best approach for handling these data issues?

Adjust the sensor calibration to avoid the duplicate and outlier values being recorded in the first place.

Manually or systematically check the anomalous data points to determine if they are truly errors. (Correct)

Use one-hot encoding to locate and replace duplicated data points.

Delete all data points that seem incorrect or duplicated without checking, because they are likely just errors.

----

A research university health department is analyzing data on risk factors for heart disease. They have collected a large dataset with hundreds of features. They want to reduce the number of features and select the most relevant ones for predicting heart disease risk.

Which feature selection technique is the best option for this universityâ€™s machine learning (ML) use case?

Feature splitting

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature combining (Correct)

Randomly reducing features by 50 percent

A nonprofit company runs a local food bank and wants to use machine learning (ML) to better predict how much food they will need to stock their pantry each month. Before building any models, they know it is important to prepare and clean their historical data on food donations and distributions.

----

Why is data cleaning and transformation an important step for this companyâ€™s ML workload?

Data cleaning transforms the data into a standardized format and handles missing values. This consistent and complete data helps machine learning models make accurate predictions. (Correct)

Without cleaning and transforming their historical data, the companyâ€™s ML model will not process the data at all.

Data cleaning is unimportant. The models will learn the patterns in the data regardless of small errors.

The company should skip cleaning the data and go straight to building models. The deep learning algorithms can handle messy data without any preparation.

Replace any outliers with the mean or median value of the remaining data.

Leave the outliers in the data set because they represent real values. 

Remove the outliers completely from the dataset before further analysis.

Keep the outliers but run statistical tests to identify any significant outliers. Determine if the outliers are natural or artificial before deciding to keep or remove outliers. (Correct)
