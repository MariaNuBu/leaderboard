      "question": "A telecommunications company uses an Amazon SageMaker ML model to predict customer turnover. The model is an XGBoost tree-based model. The tabular dataset includes both nominal categorical variables and numerical variables. A data scientist must transform the variables so that the data can be analyzed in the SageMaker environment.\n\nWhich solution should the data scientist use to help analyze the data?",
      "options": [
        "A\nUse SageMaker to perform label normalization on the numerical variables.",
