      "question": "TOPIC 3.1 Select deployment infrastructure based on existing architecture and requirements.\n\nA company built a deep learning model for climate modeling by using Amazon SageMaker. In each invocation, the model processes 400 MB of data for 30 minutes to return a prediction. The climate model is invoked automatically when a new climate event is detected. The company needs a deployment strategy to move the deep learning model to production. A cold start can be tolerated.\n\nWhat is the MOST cost-effective solution?",
      "options": [
        "A\nDeploy the model by using a real-time endpoint.",
