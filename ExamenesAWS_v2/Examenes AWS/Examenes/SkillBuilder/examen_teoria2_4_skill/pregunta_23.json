      "question": "A machine learning engineer is working on a binary classification problem to predict whether a customer will churn or not. The engineer has trained the model and obtained the following evaluation metrics:\n\n- Precision: 0.85\n- Recall: 0.70\n- F1 score: 0.77\n- Accuracy: 0.82\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding the performance of your model?",
      "options": [
        "The model has a high precision, indicating a low false positive rate. However, the lower recall suggests a higher false negative rate, meaning the model may struggle to identify churning customers accurately.",
        "The high accuracy of 0.82 suggests that the model is performing well in predicting both churning and non-churning customers.",
        "The model has a high false positive rate, meaning it may incorrectly classify non-churning customers as churning.",
        "The model has a low F1 score, indicating poor overall performance in both precision and recall."
