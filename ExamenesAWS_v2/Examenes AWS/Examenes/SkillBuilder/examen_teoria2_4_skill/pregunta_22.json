      "question": "When a machine learning engineer training a deep learning model on a classification task notices that the training and validation loss curves are converging towards each other, what does this convergence indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The model is underfitting, and it needs more training iterations or a more complex architecture.",
        "The model is experiencing mode collapse, a common issue in generative adversarial networks (GANs).",
        "The model is overfitting to the training data, and it will likely perform poorly on new, unseen data.",
        "The model has reached its optimal performance, and further training will not improve its accuracy."
