      "question": "A machine learning engineer is training a deep learning model using Amazon SageMaker. What causes the loss function to stop decreasing after a certain number of epochs when training a deep learning model using SageMaker?",
      "options": [
        "The model has reached a local minima, and further training will not improve the performance.",
        "The learning rate is too high, causing the model to overshoot the optimal solution.",
        "The training data is imbalanced, causing the model to overfit to the majority class.",
        "The model architecture is too complex, causing the model to overfit to the training data."
