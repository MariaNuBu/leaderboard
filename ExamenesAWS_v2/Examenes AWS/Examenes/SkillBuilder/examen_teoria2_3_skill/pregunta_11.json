      "question": "A machine learning engineer has been tasked with fine-tuning a pre-trained text generation model. The text generation model needs to be able to answer to industry-specific terminology and acronyms but is otherwise effective in the business solution. Which approach should you take to fine-tuning this model?",
      "options": [
        "Train the model from scratch using new or updated data.",
        "Use the pre-trained model as is and have it learn over time.",
        "Use a custom dataset to fine-tune the model with domain-specific data.",
        "Change the hyperparameters on the pre-trained model."
