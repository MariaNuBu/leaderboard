      "question": "A machine learning engineer is working on a project that involves training multiple versions of a model for sentiment analysis. Her team wants to maintain a clear record of all model versions, track their performance metrics, and ensure only approved models are deployed to production.\n\nWhich approach should the team use to achieve these goals?",
      "options": [
        "Store all model versions in a shared file system and manually keep track of their metadata and performance metrics.",
        "Use Amazon SageMaker Model Registry to register and manage different versions of the sentiment analysis model within a Model Group.",
        "Create a custom database to store model artifacts and metadata, and develop a custom approval workflow for model deployment.",
        "Train and deploy only a single version of the model because managing multiple versions would be too complex and time-consuming."
