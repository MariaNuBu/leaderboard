      "options": [
        "Monitoring is not necessary since the model was trained on historical data and will remain accurate over time.",
        "Monitoring is important to detect potential data quality issues, model performance degradation, or bias drift that may occur.",
        "Monitoring is solely focused on tracking the model's computational resource usage and infrastructure performance.",
        "Monitoring is only required during the initial deployment phase to ensure the model is functioning correctly."
