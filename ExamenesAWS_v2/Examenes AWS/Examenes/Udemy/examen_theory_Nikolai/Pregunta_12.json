      "question": "A data scientist wants to quickly build and deploy a machine learning model for image classification using Amazon SageMaker. The team has limited expertise in managing infrastructure and wants to focus on solving the business problem. Which solution would be the most efficient for the team to implement?\n\nUse SageMaker Studio to build the model using SageMaker Autopilot.\n\nExplicación\nWhile Autopilot is useful, the question specifies that the team is specifically targeting image classification, which can be easily handled by the built-in algorithm.\n\nUse a custom PyTorch model and deploy using SageMaker Python SDK.\n\nExplicación\nUsing a custom PyTorch model requires more setup and expertise in infrastructure management.",
