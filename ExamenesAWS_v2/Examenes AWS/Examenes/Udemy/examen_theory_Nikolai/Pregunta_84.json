      "question": "A machine learning engineer is designing a workflow for a document processing application. The application uses Amazon Textract to extract text and key-value pairs from scanned documents, but some documents have poor quality, requiring human verification for accuracy. The engineer decides to use Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) to handle low-confidence predictions.\nWhich workflow design is MOST suitable to integrate Amazon A2I for this task?",
      "options": [
        "Directly integrate Amazon A2I with Amazon Textract to automatically route low-confidence predictions to a human review team for validation.",
        "Use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to collect annotations and improve the Textract model accuracy over time.",
        "Use Amazon Rekognition to detect and flag poor-quality scans, and then send them to Amazon A2I for review.",
        "Implement a manual process where low-confidence Textract predictions are exported to a CSV file and sent to reviewers via email."
