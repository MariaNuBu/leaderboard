      "question": "A pharmaceutical company is using Amazon SageMaker to develop machine learning models for drug discovery. The data scientists need a solution that provides granular control over their ML pipelines to manage the steps involved in preclinical testing simulations. They also require the ability to visualize workflows for experiments as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to better understand dependencies. In addition, the solution must allow them to maintain a history of experiment trials for reproducibility and optimization, as well as tools to implement model governance for regulatory audits and compliance verifications.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
      "options": [
        "Use AWS CodePipeline for orchestration, visualize workflows as a series of stages, and implement SageMaker Experiments to maintain a running history of model discovery experiments",
        "Use SageMaker Pipelines for orchestrating ML workflows, visualize them as a DAG, and leverage SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking for auditing and compliance",
        "Use SageMaker Experiments for tracking and visualizing all workflows and rely on AWS CodePipeline for orchestration and governance",
        "Use SageMaker Pipelines for orchestration, visualize workflows as a DAG, and leverage SageMaker Experiments for model governance and compliance"
