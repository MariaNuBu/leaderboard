      "question": "You are a data scientist at a marketing agency tasked with creating a sentiment analysis model to analyze customer reviews for a new product. The company wants to quickly deploy a solution with minimal training time and development effort. You decide to leverage a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model and fine-tune it using a custom dataset of labeled customer reviews. Your team has access to both Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker JumpStart.\n\nWhich approach is the MOST APPROPRIATE for fine-tuning the pre-trained model with your custom dataset?",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker JumpStart to create a custom container for your pre-trained model and manually implement fine-tuning with TensorFlow",
        "Use Amazon Bedrock to train a model from scratch using your custom dataset, as Bedrock is optimized for training large models efficiently",
        "Use SageMaker JumpStart to deploy a pre-trained NLP model and use the built-in fine-tuning functionality with your custom dataset to create a customized sentiment analysis model",
        "Use Amazon Bedrock to select a base foundation model from a third-party provider, then fine-tune the base model directly in the Bedrock interface using your custom dataset"
      ],
