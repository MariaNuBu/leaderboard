      "question": "A company uses an ML model to generate text descriptions for product images uploaded by customers. Each uploaded image can be as large as 40 MB in size. To cost-effectively handle the inference request for these uploads, the images are saved in an Amazon S3 bucket. A data engineer needs to implement a scalable processing solution that can adapt to fluctuations in demand while minimizing operational overhead.\n\nWhat is the best solution to meet these requirements?\n\nCreate an Amazon SageMaker Real-Time Inference endpoint. Upon each image upload, trigger an AWS Lambda function to make an inference request\n\nCreate an Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference endpoint and a scaling policy. Run a script to make an inference request for each image\n\nUtilize Amazon SageMaker's Batch Transform for inference to process the images stored in the Amazon S3 bucket in bulk",
