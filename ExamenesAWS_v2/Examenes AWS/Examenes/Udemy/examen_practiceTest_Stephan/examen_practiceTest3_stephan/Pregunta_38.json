      "question": "You are preparing a dataset for training a machine learning model using SageMaker Data Wrangler. The dataset has several missing values spread across different columns, and these columns contain numeric data. Before training the model, it is essential to handle these missing values to ensure the model performs optimally. The goal is to replace the missing values in each numeric column with the mean of that column.\n\nWhich transformation in SageMaker Data Wrangler should you apply to replace the missing values in numeric columns with the mean of those columns?\n\nDrop",
