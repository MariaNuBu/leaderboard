      "question": "A retail company trained a sales forecasting ML model by preprocessing the training data using AWS Glue DataBrew. During preprocessing, the ML engineer used z-score normalization to standardize the training data. Now, the company needs to preprocess the real-time sales data for inference by applying the same z-score normalization parameters as the training data to ensure consistency in predictions.\n\nWhich solution will meet this requirement?\n\nApply a SageMaker Processing job to perform z-score normalization on the real-time sales data and automatically derive new parameters",
      "options": [
        "Apply a SageMaker Processing job to perform z-score normalization on the real-time sales data and automatically derive new parameters",
        "Export the z-score normalization recipe from AWS Glue DataBrew and apply the same recipe to preprocess the real-time sales data for inference",
        "Manually calculate the z-score normalization parameters again for the real-time sales data and use these parameters during inference preprocessing",
        "Use AWS Lambda to create a custom function for z-score normalization that calculates new parameters for each batch of sales data"
