      "question": "You are a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Engineer at a large technology company that runs multiple machine learning workloads across different environments. Your company has a variety of ML use cases, including continuous real-time predictions, scheduled batch processing for weekly model retraining, and small-scale experimentation with multiple hyperparameter tuning jobs that can tolerate failure.\n\nWhich of the following strategies represents the best use of spot instances, on-demand instances, and reserved instances for different machine learning workloads, considering the requirements for cost optimization, reliability, and performance? (Select two)",
      "options": [
        "Use spot instances for hyperparameter tuning jobs where interruptions can be tolerated",
        "Use reserved instances for real-time predictions that require high availability",
        "Use on-demand instances for hyperparameter tuning jobs where interruptions can be tolerated",
        "Use reserved instances for scheduled batch processing for model retraining",
        "Use on-demand instances for real-time predictions that require high availability"
