      "question": "You are a machine learning engineer at a tech company responsible for maintaining a recommendation engine that drives personalized content for users. The current model has been performing well, but youâ€™ve recently developed a new model that incorporates additional features and advanced techniques. Before fully replacing the existing model, you want to evaluate the new model's performance in a real-world environment. To do this, you decide to use A/B testing to compare the performance of the new model against the current model in terms of business outcomes.\n\nWhich of the following approaches is the MOST EFFECTIVE for conducting A/B testing for this use case?",
      "options": [
        "Randomly assign a percentage of users to each model and measure engagement metrics, such as click-through rates and session duration, using Amazon CloudWatch to aggregate the results and determine the winning model",
        "Fully deploy the new model and observe its performance over time. If it performs worse than the old model, revert to the previous model and analyze the differences",
        "Deploy the new model as the primary endpoint and keep the current model as a fallback. Use AWS Lambda to route a percentage of traffic to the new model and compare the predictions manually to decide which model to keep",
        "Deploy both models behind separate endpoints and use Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to track key performance metrics like accuracy and latency, choosing the better model based on these metrics"
