      "question": "You are a machine learning engineer at a company building a recommendation system using deep learning. The system is based on a neural network architecture implemented in TensorFlow. Your team wants to train the model on a large dataset stored in Amazon S3 and leverage the scalability of Amazon SageMaker. You plan to use SageMaker script mode to customize the training process while taking advantage of SageMakerâ€™s managed services.\n\nWhich of the following actions is the MOST LIKELY to help you successfully train the model using SageMaker script mode with TensorFlow?",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker script mode to automatically convert your Python script into a SageMaker Estimator object without specifying the TensorFlow framework version",
        "Create a custom Docker container with TensorFlow installed and push it to Amazon ECR, then use SageMaker script mode to launch the training job",
        "Package your TensorFlow model as a .tar.gz file, upload it to Amazon S3, and use SageMaker script mode to directly deploy the model for training",
        "Write a training script in Python that adheres to TensorFlow's Estimator API, upload it to an S3 bucket, and use SageMaker script mode with the built-in TensorFlow container to execute the script"
      ],
      "correct_answers": [
        "Write a training script in Python that adheres to TensorFlow's Estimator API, upload it to an S3 bucket, and use SageMaker script mode with the built-in TensorFlow container to execute the script"
