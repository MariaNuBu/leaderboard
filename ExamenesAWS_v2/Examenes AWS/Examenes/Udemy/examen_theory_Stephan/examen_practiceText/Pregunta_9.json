      "question": "A financial services company wants to automate its machine learning (ML) workflows to quickly respond to new training data arriving in its Amazon S3 bucket. The company needs to retrain its ML models whenever new data is added to the bucket. To automate this, they want to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS services. The solution should automatically trigger the ML model training pipeline and perform necessary preprocessing whenever new data is uploaded.\n\nWhich combination of services and configurations should the company use to achieve this? (Select TWO.)",
