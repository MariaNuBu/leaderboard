Pregunta 1:
You are deploying a SageMaker training job that handles sensitive data. Which of the following options would best ensure that the data is protected both at rest and in transit?
Enable KMS encryption for data at rest and TLS/SSL for data in transit. (Correct)
Use S3 bucket policies for access control and VPC endpoints for data transfer.
Store data in an unencrypted S3 bucket but ensure VPC isolation.
Use IAM roles to limit access and KMS for encryption in transit.

Pregunta 6:
You are configuring network isolation for a SageMaker training job to prevent data leaks. What is a potential drawback of enabling network isolation?
Increased training cost and time.
The job will lose access to S3. (Correct)
IAM roles cannot be assigned to the job.
The job cannot use VPC endpoints.

----
Pregunta 7:
Which encryption method is recommended for securing data in transit when using SageMaker?
Server-side encryption (SSE) with S3
Client-side encryption
TLS/SSL encryption (Correct)
Encryption with IAM roles
----

Pregunta 8:
You need to grant cross-account access to a KMS-encrypted S3 bucket used in a SageMaker job. What should you configure?
Create an S3 bucket policy allowing access from the other account.
Add the other account's IAM roles to the KMS key policy. (Correct)
Use AWS Shield to protect the bucket.
Enable CloudTrail logging for the bucket.

Pregunta 9:
To enhance the security of your SageMaker environment, you decide to log and monitor all AP| calls. Which
AWS service should you use?
AWS WAF
AWS CloudWatch
AWS CloudTrail (Correct)
AWS Shield

Pregunta 10:
You are tasked with setting up a highly secure SageMaker environment for training a sensitive dataset. What combination of practices would you implement?
Use public subnets and disable encryption.
Store credentials in environment variables and use public IP addresses.
Use a single IAM role with AdministratorAccess and disable logging. '
Enable network isolation, use KMS encryption, and assign least-privilege IAM roles. (Correct)
