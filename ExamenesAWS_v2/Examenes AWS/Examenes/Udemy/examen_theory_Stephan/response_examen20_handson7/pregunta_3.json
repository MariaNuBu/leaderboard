      "question": "You're implementing a customer query system that uses Amazon Bedrock's LLM agents. The agent needs to use both a knowledge base and an external API for retrieving realâ€‘time data. How should you structure the agent to meet these requirements?",
      "options": [
        "Create a single action group combining the knowledge base and the API.",
        "Use separate action groups for the knowledge base and API, guiding the LLM on when to use each.",
        "Hardcode the API calls within the LLM prompt.",
        "Train the LLM to handle both tasks without external action groups."
