      "question": "A machine learning engineer is evaluating a binary classification model that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The model has the following evaluation metrics:\nPrecision: 85%\n\nRecall: 60%\n\nWhich of the following scenarios BEST describes what this model is achieving?",
      "options": [
        "The model is good at identifying fraudulent transactions, but it misses a significant portion of actual fraudulent transactions.",
        "The model correctly identifies a high proportion of fraudulent transactions but often misses actual fraudulent cases.",
        "The model often predicts non-fraudulent transactions as fraudulent, leading to a high number of false positives.",
        "The model is good at correctly identifying most fraudulent transactions but occasionally misclassifies non-fraudulent transactions."

        "The model is good at identifying fraudulent transactions, but it misses a significant portion of actual fraudulent transactions."
