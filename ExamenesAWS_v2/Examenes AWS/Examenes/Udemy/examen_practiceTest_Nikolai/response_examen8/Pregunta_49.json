      "question": "A data scientist is working to improve the generalization of their machine learning model and reduce overfitting. They have been advised to use cross-validation, add more training data, and apply regularization techniques. Which of the following best describes the purpose and impact of using regularization?",
      "options": [
        "Regularization simplifies the model by penalizing extreme parameter values, reducing overfitting risk.",
        "Regularization increases model complexity to improve performance on diverse datasets.",
        "Regularization rotates through different subsets of data to enhance model generalization.",
        "Regularization augments data size by adding synthetic samples from minority classes."
