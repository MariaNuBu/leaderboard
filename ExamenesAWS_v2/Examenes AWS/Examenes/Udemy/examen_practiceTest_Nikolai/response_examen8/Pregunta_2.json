      "question": "Pregunta 2\n\nA machine learning team wants to identify the most important features in their dataset using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler's \"Quick Model\" feature. What is the primary purpose of using this feature?\n\nTo apply advanced deep learning techniques for feature engineering.\n\nExplicaci√≥n\nThe Quick Model feature is not designed for deep learning or advanced feature engineering; it's meant to provide a quick, initial evaluation of feature importance.",
      "options": [
        "To apply advanced deep learning techniques for feature engineering.",
        "To automatically split the dataset, train a simple model, and evaluate feature importance.",
        "To visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset to identify highly correlated features.",
        "To perform automated hyperparameter tuning for the best model performance."
