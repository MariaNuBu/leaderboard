      "question": "\nA data analyst wants to extract meaningful insights from unstructured customer feedback stored in Amazon S3. The insights should include key entities like people, organizations, and locations mentioned in the feedback, as well as the overall sentiment of the feedback. Which combination of Amazon Comprehend features should the analyst use to achieve this goal?\n\nKeyphrase Extraction and Topic Modeling\n\nExplicación\nKeyphrase Extraction identifies significant phrases, but it does not identify entities or determine sentiment.
