      "question": "A Machine Learning Engineer is using Amazon SageMaker to build and train a binary classification model. The training dataset contains a severe class imbalance, with 95% of the data belonging to the negative class and only 5% to the positive class. After training, the model achieves high accuracy but performs poorly on the positive class.\n\nWhich two techniques should the engineer consider to address this issue? (Choose TWO.)",
      "options": [
        "Use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the evaluation metric.",
        "Decrease the size of the negative class through undersampling.",
        "Increase the size of the positive class through oversampling.",
        "Apply class weights to penalize misclassification of the minority class.",
        "Use precision as the primary evaluation metric instead of accuracy."

        "Increase the size of the positive class through oversampling.",
