Pregunta 1:
Which step is most critical before deploying a SageMaker model using a Docker container?
Validate the model using SageMaker JumpStart. (Correct)
Ensure the model is stored in /opt/ml/model within the container.
Set up Auto Scaling policies for the endpoint.
Use SageMaker Neo to compile the model.

Pregunta 10:
Which of the following is a key benefit of using Docker containers in Amazon SageMaker?

Containers are tied to a specific instance type.
Containers allow the use of any script or algorithm regardless of runtime or language. (Correct)
Containers must use SageMaker built-in algorithms only.
Containers cannot be used for inference tasks.
