They have noticed that during peak traffic times, the model needs to scale quickly to handle the increased number of transactions without losing accuracy. How should they configure their fraud detection system to ensure scalability and real-time detection?\n\nUse Amazon SageMaker to train a custom fraud detection model and manually manage its deployment during high-traffic periods.\n\nExplicaci√≥n\nSageMaker is not required here, as Amazon Fraud Detector already provides a scalable, fully managed fraud detection service tailored to real-time fraud detection.",
