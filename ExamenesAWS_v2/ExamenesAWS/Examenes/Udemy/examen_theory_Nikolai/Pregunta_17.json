Which combination of services and configurations should be used to achieve this? (Choose two)\n\nUse AWS Glue to run the analysis on data as it arrives in the S3 bucket.\nSet up the Lambda function to trigger based on events from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.\nUse Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and stream the data from IoT devices.\nConfigure an AWS Lambda function to trigger on S3 'PUT' events to process the streaming data.\nCreate an Amazon S3 bucket to directly store raw IoT data without any processing.",
