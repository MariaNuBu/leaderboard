      "question": "A company is building a machine learning model to predict loan approvals and wants to ensure that the model is fair and unbiased.\nThey plan to use Amazon SageMaker Clarify for bias detection and explainability.\nAdditionally, the company needs to handle class imbalance in the training data, which has far fewer approved loan applications compared to rejected ones.\nThey also want to automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data preparation to model deployment.\nWhich combination of AWS services should the company use to achieve these goals? (Choose Two.)",
