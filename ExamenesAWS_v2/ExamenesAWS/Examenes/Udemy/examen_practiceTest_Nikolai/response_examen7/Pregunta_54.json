      "question": "A manufacturing company is using machine learning to predict equipment failures. The company has data on equipment usage, temperature, and maintenance records stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. They need to clean and analyze this data, engineer features such as average machine temperature over time, and store these features for both batch and real-time predictions. The company also wants to utilize a pre-built machine learning model to accelerate the deployment process.\n\nWhich combination of services would BEST meet the company's needs?",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker Data Wrangler to clean and preprocess the data, store the features in Amazon Redshift, and use SageMaker JumpStart to deploy a pre-built model.",
        "Use Amazon EMR to preprocess the data, store the features in Amazon DynamoDB, and use SageMaker to train and deploy the model.",
        "Use SageMaker Data Wrangler to clean and transform the data, store the features in SageMaker Feature Store, and use SageMaker JumpStart to deploy a pre-built predictive maintenance model.",
        "Use SageMaker Notebooks to preprocess the data, store the features in Amazon S3, and use SageMaker Autopilot to train and deploy a predictive model."

      "correct_answers": [
        "Use SageMaker Data Wrangler to clean and transform the data, store the features in SageMaker Feature Store, and use SageMaker JumpStart to deploy a pre-built predictive maintenance model."
