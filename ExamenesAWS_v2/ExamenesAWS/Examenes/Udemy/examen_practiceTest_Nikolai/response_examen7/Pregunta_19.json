      "question": "A machine learning engineer is tasked with building a predictive model for an e-commerce platform using Amazon SageMaker. The team is considering whether to use a SageMaker Notebook Instance or SageMaker Studio. The engineer needs the following features:\n- The ability to run multiple notebooks in parallel within the same environment.\n- A centralized space for persistent storage of datasets, notebooks, and logs.\n- Seamless integration with existing AWS services like S3 and IAM.\n\nWhich SageMaker environment should the engineer choose, and why?",
      "options": [
        "SageMaker Notebook Instance because it allows running multiple notebooks in isolated environments, ensuring that tasks remain independent.",
        "SageMaker Studio because it is specifically designed for large-scale deep learning workloads, offering GPU-based instances for parallel notebook execution.",
        "SageMaker Notebook Instance because it provides access to the full AWS CLI, enabling tighter control over resources and configurations.",
        "SageMaker Studio because it offers a persistent Jupyter Lab space where multiple notebooks can be managed, allowing centralized data access and integration with AWS services."
      ],
