      "question": "A machine learning engineer is tasked with training a custom PyTorch model using Amazon SageMaker. They want to take advantage of SageMaker's pre-built PyTorch container while maintaining control over the training logic. The engineer also needs to include several custom Python libraries to handle specific pre-processing tasks.\n\nWhat steps should the engineer follow to set up and train the model using SageMaker's Script Mode?",
      "options": [
        "Use AWS Lambda to trigger a training job, passing the model and training script from the notebook instance.",
        "Create a custom Docker container for the model, push it to Amazon ECR, and pull it into SageMaker for training.",
        "Write a Python script with the training logic, specify it as an entry point in the SageMaker estimator, and include a requirements.txt file to install custom libraries during training.",
        "Install the required Python packages directly on the SageMaker notebook instance and run the training using the SageMaker built-in algorithms."
