      "options": [
        "Use Kinesis Firehose to automatically scale the stream based on traffic.",
        "Manually scale shards based on throughput requirements.",
        "Use enhanced fan-out to reduce consumer latency and ensure dedicated throughput per consumer.",
        "Enable provisioned mode and dynamically add shards."
