      "question": "A machine learning engineer is using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to prepare data for training a model. The dataset has missing values, inconsistent scales across features, and categorical data. Which of the following actions can the engineer perform using Data Wrangler to resolve these issues? (Choose THREE)",
      "options": [
        "Manually code all the transformations using Python and upload the final dataset to SageMaker.",
        "Normalize feature values to ensure all features are on a similar scale.",
        "One-hot encode categorical data to convert it into a numerical format.",
        "Use Amazon EMR to pre-process the data for missing values and scaling.",
        "Perform imputation to fill in missing values using strategies like mean or median."
