      "question": "You are evaluating the performance of a machine learning model and want to ensure that it generalizes well on unseen data. You decide to partition your dataset into three distinct sets: training, validation, and testing. However, your model performs exceptionally well on the training set but poorly on the validation and test sets. What is the likely cause of this performance discrepancy?",
      "options": [
        "The model is underfitting the data.",
        "The model has a high bias and low variance.",
        "The model is overfitting the training data.",
        "The training set is too small for meaningful evaluation."
      ],
      "correct_answers": [
        "The model is overfitting the training data."
