      "question": "A financial services company is using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to track the feature attribution drift of their credit risk prediction model. They notice that the importance of a particular feature, \"annual income,\" has shifted significantly over time, making it a more dominant factor in the model's predictions.\n\nWhat is the BEST course of action to address this shift in feature importance?",
      "options": [
        "Switch to a different model algorithm that automatically reduces the importance of \"annual income\" in predictions.",
        "Retrain the model with a larger dataset that excludes the \"annual income\" feature to prevent bias in predictions.",
        "Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the existing model to lower the weight of the \"annual income\" feature.",
        "Use SageMaker Model Monitor to alert the team about this shift and retrain the model with updated data to ensure feature importance remains balanced."
      ],
      "correct_answers": [
        "Use SageMaker Model Monitor to alert the team about this shift and retrain the model with updated data to ensure feature importance remains balanced."
