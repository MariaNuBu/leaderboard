      "question": "A team is training a neural network model in Amazon SageMaker. During training, they notice that the model's performance has plateaued, and suspect a vanishing gradient issue. How can they leverage SageMaker Debugger to diagnose and address this problem?",
      "options": [
        "Set up custom debug rules to capture disappearing gradients and adjust the learning rate as needed.",
        "Enable SageMaker Clarify to detect vanishing gradients during training.",
        "Use cross-validation to rotate training data, preventing gradient loss.",
        "Increase the training epochs until SageMaker Debugger resolves the issue."
