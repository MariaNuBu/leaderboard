      "question": "Machine learning team is tasked with preparing a dataset for a model that will predict customer churn. They decide to use SageMaker Data Wrangler to streamline the data preparation. The dataset contains time-based information, and they want to engineer new features such as \"day of the week\" from timestamps and assess the importance of these features.\nWhat TWO features of SageMaker Data Wrangler will assist the team in this process? (Choose TWO)",
