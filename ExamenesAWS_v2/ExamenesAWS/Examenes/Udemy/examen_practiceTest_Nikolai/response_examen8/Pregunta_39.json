      "question": "A financial firm is using Amazon SageMaker to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) model for optimizing portfolio management. The agent is tasked with adjusting the portfolio by buying, selling, or holding assets in a fluctuating market. To ensure the agent maximizes the long-term return while minimizing risk, how should the reward function be structured?",
      "options": [
        "The reward function should penalize any change in the portfolio and reward only large gains in asset value.",
        "The reward function should reward every transaction made by the agent to encourage exploration of different strategies.",
        "The reward function should provide small rewards for gains in asset value and larger penalties for significant losses, to encourage both risk management and profit maximization.",
        "The reward function should only reward short-term profit increases, ensuring the agent takes immediate action for portfolio growth."
