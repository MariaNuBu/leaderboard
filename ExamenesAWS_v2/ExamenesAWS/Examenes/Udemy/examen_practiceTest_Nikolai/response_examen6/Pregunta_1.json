      "question": "A media company uses AWS Glue for processing and analyzing streaming video metadata stored in Amazon S3, with a requirement to make the processed data available in a SQL-like queryable format for quick insights. Given the need to regularly update the metadata catalog and the integration with analytics services, which TWO actions should be implemented to optimize the processing workflow in AWS Glue? (Choose Two)\n\nRely on Amazon Redshift Spectrum to handle the ETL processes directly from the S3 data lake, eliminating the need for AWS Glue.\n\nSchedule AWS Glue ETL jobs to perform transformations only during off-peak hours to reduce impact on operational costs and resource utilization.\n\nConfigure incremental data loads in Glue ETL jobs to ensure only newly added data is processed, thus minimizing compute resources and processing time.\n\nUtilize AWS Glue crawlers to automatically infer schema from new data and update the Glue Data Catalog, ensuring data remains queryable with updated schema.\n\nEnable AWS Glue Studio to manage ETL jobs and transformations visually, thereby simplifying the modification and deployment of data pipelines.",
