      "question": "A data scientist is using Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to preprocess data for a machine learning project. The data is stored in Amazon Redshift and contains missing values. The scientist needs to handle these missing values before training a model.\nWhich of the following options are valid methods for handling missing values in Data Wrangler? (Choose TWO)",
      "options": [
        "Impute missing values using the mean or median of the column",
        "Drop all rows that contain missing values",
        "Automatically replace missing values with zeros",
        "Use interpolation to estimate missing values based on related features",
