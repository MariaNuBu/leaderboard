        "The bias versus variance trade-off refers to the challenge of balancing the error due to the model's complexity (variance) and the error due to incorrect assumptions in the model (bias), where high bias can cause underfitting and high variance can cause overfitting",
        "The bias versus variance trade-off refers to the balance between underfitting and overfitting, where high bias leads to overfitting and high variance leads to underfitting"
