      "question": "A transportation company has trained an ML model in Amazon SageMaker to predict delivery times based on real-time traffic data. The company needs to deploy the model in a production environment to meet the following requirements:\n\nEnsure high availability to provide predictions without interruptions.\n\nAchieve low latency for real-time predictions on delivery schedules.\n\nProcess input data sizes ranging between 1 KB and 5 MB.\n\nHandle unpredictable surges in requests during peak traffic hours.\n\nScale dynamically to match fluctuating demand throughout the day.\n\nWhich of the following represents the best solution for the given scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon SageMaker serverless inference to automatically scale inferences based on demand, eliminating the need for endpoint management",
        "Deploy the model using Amazon SageMaker real-time inference with an auto-scaling endpoint to manage bursts in traffic and provide high availability",
        "Deploy the model using Amazon SageMaker asynchronous inference to handle unpredictable surges and process requests efficiently to meet strict low-latency requirements",
        "Deploy the model using Amazon SageMaker batch transform to process predictions in batches during peak hours to optimize resource utilization"
