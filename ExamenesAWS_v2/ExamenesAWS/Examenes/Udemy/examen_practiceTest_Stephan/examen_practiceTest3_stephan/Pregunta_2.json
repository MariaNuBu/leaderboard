      "question": "A healthcare company is building an application that uses multiple scikit-learn models to predict disease risk factors based on patient data. The company wants to deploy these models using Amazon SageMaker to serve real-time predictions with low latency. The solution must be cost-effective while ensuring efficient traffic handling for all deployed models.\n\nWhich of the following options must be combined to develop a solution that meets these requirements? (Select two)",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoint to host multiple scikit-learn models in one container behind a single endpoint, reducing infrastructure costs",
        "Deploy each scikit-learn model individually on separate SageMaker Real-Time Endpoints to ensure traffic is isolated for each model",
        "Package all scikit-learn models into separate containers and deploy them behind a single SageMaker Real-Time Endpoint",
        "Use SageMaker Real-Time Inference to deploy the Multi-Model Endpoint for low-latency predictions and optimized traffic handling",
        "Use SageMaker Serverless Inference to deploy each model and configure an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic across all model endpoints"
