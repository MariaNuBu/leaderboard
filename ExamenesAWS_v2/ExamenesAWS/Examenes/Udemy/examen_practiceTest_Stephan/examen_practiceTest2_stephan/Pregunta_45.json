      "question": "A company is using a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances to ingest data from on-premises data sources. The data is in JSON format and ingestion rates can be as high as 1 MB/s. When an EC2 instance is rebooted, the data in flight is lost. The companyâ€™s data science team wants to query ingested data in near-real time.\n\nWhich solution provides near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss?",
      "options": [
        "Store ingested data in an EC2 instance store. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon S3 as the destination. Use Amazon Athena to query the data",
