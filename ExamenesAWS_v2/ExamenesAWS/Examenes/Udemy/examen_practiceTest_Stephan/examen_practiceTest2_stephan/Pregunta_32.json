      "question": "You are a data scientist at an e-commerce company working to develop a recommendation system for customers. After building several models, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and a deep learning model, you find that each model excels in different scenarios. For example, the collaborative filtering model works well for returning customers with rich interaction data, while the content-based filtering model performs better for new customers with little interaction history. Your goal is to combine these models to create a recommendation system that provides more accurate and personalized recommendations across all customer segments.\n\nWhich of the following strategies is the MOST LIKELY to achieve this goal?",
      "options": [
        "Use a bagging approach to train multiple instances of the deep learning model on different subsets of the data and average their predictions to improve overall performance",
        "Use stacking, where the predictions from the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models are fed into a deep learning model as inputs, allowing the deep learning model to make the final recommendation",
        "Implement a hybrid model that combines the predictions of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning using a weighted average, where weights are based on model performance for different customer segments",
        "Apply boosting by sequentially training the collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning models, where each model corrects the errors of the previous one"
