      "question": "You are a data scientist working on a machine learning project to predict customer lifetime value (CLV) for an e-commerce company. Before deploying a complex model like a deep neural network, you need to establish a performance baseline to measure the effectiveness of your advanced models. You decide to use Amazon SageMaker to create this baseline efficiently. The goal is to build a simple model that can be easily implemented and provide a reference point for evaluating the performance of more sophisticated models later.\n\nWhich of the following approaches is the MOST EFFECTIVE for creating a performance baseline using Amazon SageMaker?\n\nDeploy a SageMaker BlazingText model to create word embeddings from customer reviews, which can be used as a baseline for evaluating CLV predictions\n\nImplement SageMaker Autopilot to automatically explore various models and select the best one as the baseline, allowing you to skip manual model selection",
      "options": [
        "Deploy a SageMaker BlazingText model to create word embeddings from customer reviews, which can be used as a baseline for evaluating CLV predictions",
        "Implement SageMaker Autopilot to automatically explore various models and select the best one as the baseline, allowing you to skip manual model selection",
        "Train a basic linear learner model using Amazon SageMaker, focusing on key features like customer age, purchase frequency, and average order value, to establish a baseline for CLV prediction",
        "Use SageMaker JumpStart to deploy a pre-trained model for customer segmentation, which can serve as a baseline for your CLV prediction model"
