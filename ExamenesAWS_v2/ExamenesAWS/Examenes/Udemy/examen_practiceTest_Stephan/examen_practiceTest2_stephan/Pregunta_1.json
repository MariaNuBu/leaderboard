      "question": "A financial services company deployed a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference in the past with successful performance. Now, the company needs to deploy a new ML model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time within their banking application. However, when using SageMaker Asynchronous Inference for this new model, the performance is poor and does not meet the real-time requirements. Additionally, the company wants to receive notifications whenever there is a deviation in the model's quality.\n\nAs an AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate, what do you recommend?",
      "options": [
        "Switch to SageMaker Real-Time Inference for the deployment and use SageMaker Model Monitor for model quality deviations",
        "Retain SageMaker Asynchronous Inference and enable autoscaling for the endpoint to improve performance, while using Amazon SQS for notifications",
        "Increase the instance size and response timeout settings for SageMaker Asynchronous Inference and use Amazon SNS for quality deviation notifications",
        "Use SageMaker Batch Transform for inference and set up a monitoring system with SageMaker Model Monitor to send notifications for quality deviations"
