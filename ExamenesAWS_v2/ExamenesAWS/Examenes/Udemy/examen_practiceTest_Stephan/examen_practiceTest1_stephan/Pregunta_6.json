      "question": "A research organization collects weather data from multiple sensor devices across various locations. The data is stored as CSV files in a central Amazon S3 bucket. The CSV files contain the same schema, with an observation date column to record when each reading was taken. The organization needs to perform ad-hoc queries on the data to filter and analyze based on the observation date.\n\nThe solution must enable efficient querying. Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon Athena and run a CTAS (CREATE TABLE AS SELECT) query with partitioning enabled on the observation date column to query and optimize the CSV files based on the observation date column",
        "Use Amazon EMR with Apache Hive to preprocess the CSV files and filter the data using HiveQL",
        "Stream the new CSV files into Amazon Redshift and query the data using SQL filters on the observation date column",
        "Use AWS Glue to create an ETL job that partitions and transforms the CSV files for querying by the observation date and processes the output into a new S3 bucket"
      ],

        "Use Amazon Athena and run a CTAS (CREATE TABLE AS SELECT) query with partitioning enabled on the observation date column to query and optimize the CSV files based on the observation date column"
