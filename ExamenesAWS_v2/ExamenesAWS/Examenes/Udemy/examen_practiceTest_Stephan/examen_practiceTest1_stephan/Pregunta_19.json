      "question": "A retail company has deployed a machine learning (ML) model using Amazon SageMaker to forecast product demand. The model is exposed via a SageMaker endpoint that processes requests from multiple applications. The company needs to record and monitor all API call events made to the endpoint and receive a notification whenever the number of requests exceeds a specific threshold during peak traffic hours.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?\n\nUse SageMaker Model Monitor to capture and analyze endpoint traffic and configure a rule to notify when API calls exceed the specified threshold",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker Model Monitor to capture and analyze endpoint traffic and configure a rule to notify when API calls exceed the specified threshold",
        "Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the API call metrics for the SageMaker endpoint and create an alarm to send notifications through Amazon SNS when the call count breaches the threshold",
        "Enable AWS CloudTrail to log all SageMaker API call events and use CloudTrail Insights to send notifications when the API call volume exceeds a threshold",
        "Use Amazon EventBridge to capture SageMaker API call events and configure a rule to send a notification when the event count breaches the threshold"
