      "question": "A research team at a university is working on developing a new machine learning (ML) algorithm for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They want to use Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy their algorithm on large-scale datasets. Which steps should they follow to bring their custom algorithm to SageMaker using script mode?",
      "options": [
        "Write the training script in Python, create a SageMaker estimator, and call the fit method to launch the training job.",
        "Create a custom SageMaker container image with their algorithm and dependencies and use it to train and deploy their model.",
        "Implement their algorithm as a SageMaker built-in algorithm and use it like any other pre-built algorithm.",
        "Develop and train their algorithm locally, and then use SageMaker for deployment and inference only."
