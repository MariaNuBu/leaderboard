      "question": "A machine learning engineer is working on a binary classification task to predict whether an email is spam or not. They have trained their model using the binary cross-entropy loss function and gradient descent optimization. However, they notice that the model's performance on the validation set is not improving, despite a decrease in the training loss. What could be a potential reason for this behavior?",
      "options": [
        "The batch size is too small, causing the optimizer to converge slowly.",
        "The model is overfitting to the training data and failing to generalize to the validation set.",
        "The learning rate is too high, causing the optimizer to overshoot the global minimum.",
        "The binary cross-entropy loss function is not suitable for this classification task."
