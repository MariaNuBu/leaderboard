      "question": "A retail company wants to build a machine learning (ML) model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The data includes features such as customer demographics, purchase history, and interactions with the company's website and mobile app. The company's data science team has decided to use Amazon SageMaker to train the model. Which of the following approaches would require the least amount of effort to train the model using SageMaker?",
      "options": [
        "Use a SageMaker built-in algorithm for supervised learning, such as the XGBoost algorithm, and provide the customer data as input.",
        "Bring your own custom Python script that implements a machine learning algorithm of your choice, and use SageMaker script mode to train the model.",
        "Create a custom Docker container with the desired machine learning framework and libraries, and bring your own container in SageMaker to train the model.",
        "Use AWS Marketplace to purchase a pre-trained customer churn prediction model from a third-party vendor."
