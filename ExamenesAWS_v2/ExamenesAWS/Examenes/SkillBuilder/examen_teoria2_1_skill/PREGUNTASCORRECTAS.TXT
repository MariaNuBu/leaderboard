A ML engineer for a healthcare company is building a machine learning (ML) model that can help to diagnose illnesses based on a series of test results. It is crucial that medical professionals are able to ascertain the reasons behind the diagnoses to help determine care and to also explain their reasoning to their patients. When balancing model interpretability and model performance, which statement would best describe the priorities used when selecting an algorithm?

Select an algorithm with a very high model interpretability while putting much less emphasis on model performance.

Select an algorithm with a very high model performance while putting much less emphasis on model interpretability.

Select an algorithm that balances both model interpretability and model performance identically. (Correct)

Only model performance matters. Model interpretability should have no bearing on your decision.

A developer is building a ML model that will use deep learning to have lifelike conversations with humans. The model will be very intensive, involve parallel processing, and have an extremely large dataset. When determining whether to use a CPU or GPU instance for this scenario, which statement is true?

CPUs would be a more cost-effective solution, so CPUs should be used.
Either CPUs or GPUs would work. Use whichever one works with your developed model.
Because the model is quite intensive and complex, using GPUs would provide significant performance gains despite generally costing more compared to CPUs. (Correct)
Because the model uses parallel processing, CPUs should be used to streamline the processing. The model would be faster by using CPUs compared to using GPUs.

A developer is building an image generation model for their company. They want their model to be trained on high-definition images and to be able to output images of the highest quality. The dataset they are training it on is large. Which of these statements is true regarding the decision between using a CPU or GPU instance, when balancing for cost efficiency?

Although choosing a CPU might result in a more cost-efficient model, the performance might suffer too much, given the dataset and output required. For this reason, GPU should be selected. (Correct)

Because they are dealing with images and not video, a CPU could be more cost efficient because they will not need as much processing power.

This is a simpler model, so CPU should be chosen to drive costs down.

GPU should be selected because it would be a more cost-efficient solution to this model.

A developer is building a machine learning (ML) model that can review customer information and determine whether the customer is approved for certain financial services. When determining between model performance and model interpretability, which statement would be true?

The financial industry requires that models be transparent and explainable to ensure fair lending practices and prevent discrimination. Many financial institutions also face strict regulatory and compliance requirements. For this reason, a model with a high model interpretability should be chosen over high performance. (Correct)

They want the model to get to the correct answer, so model interpretability is the most important aspect of the model design.

The model is too complex to worry about interpretability, if it reaches the correct conclusion. Because of the complexity, they should prioritize model performance.

They want to get this information quickly to customers, so model performance is more important than interpretability in this instance.

A machine learning (ML) engineer is deciding whether to use AWS artificial intelligence (AI) services or AWS ML services for a common business need. What might be a reason to use AWS AI services?

AWS AI services are often cheaper than other solutions but lack performance.

With AWS AI services, you can build highly specialized models from scratch.

AWS AI services are pre-built and fully managed services that solve common business needs such as image recognition and text translation. Because they are prebuilt and fully managed, you can get up and running with very little configuration. (Correct)

With AWS AI services, you can choose from several algorithms, which can then be fine-tuned to support your business needs in a more specialized manner.
