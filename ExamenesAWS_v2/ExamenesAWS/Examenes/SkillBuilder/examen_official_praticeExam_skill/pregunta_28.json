      "question": "An ML engineer is using the Amazon SageMaker AI XGBoost algorithm to develop a diagnostic tool. The tool uses multiple indicators to predict whether a patient has a specific disease. The dataset includes data from a large number of patients classified as healthy and a small number of patients diagnosed with the disease. Initial tests show that the model can consistently identify a patient who does not have the disease. However, the model cannot accurately predict whether a patient has the disease. Which adjustment should the ML engineer make to improve the model's ability to accurately predict which patients have the disease?",
