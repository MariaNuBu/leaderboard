A compliance audit discovers that an Amazon S3 bucket for training data uses server-side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\n\nThe company requires customer managed keys. An ML engineer changes the S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). The ML engineer makes no other configuration changes.\n\nAfter the change to the encryption settings, SageMaker AI training jobs start to fail with AccessDenied errors.\n\nWhat should the ML engineer do to resolve this problem?",
