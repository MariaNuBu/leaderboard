A company builds and deploys ML models by using Amazon SageMaker AI. The models are used across multiple departments. The company allocates a monthly budget that each department can spend on AWS services. The company wants to ensure that each department knows when the department's monthly spend is likely to exceed the allocated budget. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A.
Create a budget in AWS Budgets with a fixed method. Specify a filter based on user-defined cost allocation tags that are associated with each department. Configure the budget to trigger an alert and notify the department based on the forecasted monthly spend.

Correct. You can use AWS Budgets to track and take actions based on AWS spend. You can use a fixed method for AWS Budgets to define a static budget every month. You can use user-defined cost allocation tags to monitor costs based on tags that you create, such as department ID or project ID. You can use AWS Budgets to establish filters based on tags and to trigger alerts. By configuring an alert based on the forecasted monthly spend, you can anticipate the likelihood of your monthly spend exceeding a defined threshold.

B
Create a budget in AWS Budgets with an auto-adjusting method. Specify a filter based on AWS generated cost allocation tags that are associated with each department. Configure the budget to trigger an alert and notify the department based on the actual monthly spend.

Incorrect. You can use AWS Budgets to track and take actions based on AWS spend. However, the auto-adjusting method sets a dynamic budget based on previous spend instead of on a fixed threshold. AWS generated cost allocation tags do not incorporate business logic, such as department ID or project ID. You can set an alert based on actual monthly spend. However, then the departments will not be able to anticipate when the monthly spend is likely to exceed the allocated budget. The budget would be based on a fixed threshold or threshold percentage.

Correct. You can use SageMaker AI automatic model tuning to adjust hyperparameters with minimal effort. You can use SageMaker AI automatic tuning to optimize hyperparameters while keeping the underlying model type the same. This functionality automates the process to identify the best hyperparameter configuration. Therefore, this solution significantly reduces effort compared to manual tuning.

Learn more about SageMaker AI automatic model tuning.


B
SageMaker AI notebook with a custom random search

Incorrect. A SageMaker AI notebook with a custom random search could potentially adjust hyperparameters. However, this method requires more effort than using automatic model tuning. You would need to write code, manage the search process, and analyze results manually. Additionally, random search is often less efficient than the more advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques that are offered by SageMaker AI automatic model tuning.

Learn more about random search.


C
SageMaker Autopilot with the default configuration

Incorrect. SageMaker Autopilot with the default configuration does not meet the requirement to keep the underlying model type the same. SageMaker Autopilot is designed to automatically try different algorithms and model types to find the best performing model. SageMaker Autopilot provides customized selection of algorithms for training. However, the default configuration uses the full set of available algorithms.

Pregunta 5

An ML engineer trained an ML model by using a tabular dataset. The dataset contains 1,000 data points with 5,000 features. The ML engineer needs to reduce overfitting to improve the model's performance. Which solution will reduce overfitting the MOST for the model?

A
Reduce the number of features by applying principal component analysis (PCA).

Correct. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that calculates a new set of features. PCA can reduce the number of features while retaining as much variability in the data as possible. By transforming the original features into principal components, PCA minimizes the feature space. Therefore, PCA addresses the root cause of overfitting. PCA is effective in use cases where the dataset contains many more features than data points. Having many more features than data points increases the likelihood of overfitting because of data sparsity.

Learn more about overfitting.

Learn more about PCA in Amazon SageMaker AI.


B
Increase the number of features by deriving new features from the existing features.

Incorrect. A solution that introduces additional features is more likely to increase overfitting than reduce overfitting. The current issue is that there are already too many features (5,000) compared to the number of data points (1,000). A solution that adds more features would further increase the dimensionality of the data. Then, the model would be more susceptible to fitting noise in the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. This solution does not meet the requirement to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance.


C
Reduce the number of data points by randomly dropping 100 data points.

Incorrect. A solution that reduces the number of data points by randomly dropping 100 samples would not effectively address the overfitting issue. The issue is that there are too many features (5,000) compared to the number of data points (1,000). A solution that decreases the number of data points to 900 would slightly increase the data sparsity. Therefore, this solution could increase overfitting. This solution does not meet the requirement to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance.


D
Increase the number of data points by collecting 100 additional data points.

Incorrect. You can increase the number of data points to reduce overfitting. However, a solution that adds only 100 samples would not significantly change the ratio of data points to features in this scenario. The dataset would still have 1,100 data points compared to 5,000 features. This solution maintains a high level of data sparsity. The minor increase in data points is insufficient to address the fundamental issue of having too many features relative to the number of samples. A bigger increase in data points or a reduction in features would be necessary to effectively reduce overfitting.

Report Content Errors

A
Use pipe mode as the input mode for the training job configuration.

Correct. Pipe mode is an input mode for SageMaker AI training jobs that streams data directly from Amazon S3. This streaming approach can significantly reduce startup times for training jobs. This approach is especially helpful for large datasets, like the 50 GB of images in the scenario. Pipe mode is the most cost-effective option to meet the requirement to reduce training job startup time. Pipe mode does not require any additional infrastructure or services. Therefore, this approach is the most suitable for daily re-training.

Learn more about pipe mode.


B
Use an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to stream data from Amazon S3 to the training job.

Incorrect. You can use FSx for Lustre to stream data from Amazon S3 to the training job. This method would likely speed up the startup time. However, this solution is not the most cost-effective option. FSx for Lustre introduces additional costs for the file system.

Learn more about FSx for Lustre.


C
Change the instance type of the Amazon EC2 instance that the training job uses.

Incorrect. You can change the instance type of the EC2 instance that you use for the training job. However, this solution will not directly address the slow startup time issue. The startup time is caused by the time taken to download the 50 GB of image data from Amazon S3 to the training instance. An increase in instance size might process the data faster after the data is loaded. However, this method will not significantly improve the initial data transfer time. Additionally, using a different instance type could increase costs without addressing the core problem.

Learn more about instance types.


D
Load the training data onto an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to the training job instance.

Incorrect. To load the training data onto an EBS volume and attach the volume to the training job instance is not a viable solution for SageMaker AI training jobs. SageMaker AI manages the infrastructure for training jobs. You cannot directly attach EBS volumes to managed instances. This solution does not align with the SageMaker AI managed training infrastructure. Additionally, this solution would not effectively address the startup time issue.

Learn more about automatic scaling for SageMaker AI endpoints.


B
Increase the number of EC2 instances to meet the expected peak demand.

Incorrect. To increase the number of EC2 instances to meet expected peak demand is a static scaling approach. This approach does not efficiently accommodate the large increases and decreases in user traffic. This solution does not dynamically adjust resources based on actual demand. Dynamic scaling is essential for cost optimization in a production environment with variable traffic.

Learn more about automatic scaling for SageMaker AI endpoints.


C
Configure a target tracking scaling policy based on a metric in Amazon CloudWatch.

Correct. A target tracking scaling policy can automatically adjust the number of instances that are provisioned based on inference requests and workload. You can configure a target tracking scaling policy that is based on a metric in CloudWatch. Then, the policy can accommodate large increases and decreases in user traffic for the SageMaker AI endpoint. This solution provides dynamic scaling of EC2 instances based on real-time metrics. Therefore, this solution can ensure that the number of instances support the actual demand.

Learn more about target tracking scaling for SageMaker AI endpoints.


D
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Register the endpoint as a target for the ALB.

Incorrect. You can deploy an ALB and register the SageMaker AI endpoint as a target to help distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. However, this solution does not directly address the requirement to accommodate large increases and decreases in user traffic in a cost-effective manner. An ALB can improve availability and distribute load. However, an ALB does not provide the automatic scaling capabilities you need to adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

Pregunta 8

A company is deploying a computer vision model in retail stores. The model is for live self-checkout fraud detection and is deployed on an Amazon SageMaker AI real-time inference endpoint.

After updates to the model, the company must validate the updated model on 10% of customers before making the model immediately available to all customers. The company has already created Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor the endpoint. The company will use the SageMaker UpdateEndpoint API operation for the deployment.

Which deployment configuration will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Use a canary deployment. In the CanarySize field, specify CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 10.

Correct. In canary deployment, you deploy the new model version to a small group of customers before you roll out the new model version to all customers. A canary deployment with the CanarySize field set to CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 10 meets the requirements. This configuration will validate the updated model on 10% of all incoming requests before full rollout. This configuration directs 10% of traffic to the new model version.

B
Use a canary deployment. In the CanarySize field, specify CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 90.

Incorrect. In canary deployment, you deploy the new model version to a small group of customers before you roll out the new model version to all customers. Setting CanarySize to CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 90 would direct 90% of traffic to the new model version. This configuration does not meet the requirement to validate the updated model on only 10% of incoming requests before full rollout. This configuration would expose the majority of customers to the unvalidated model. Therefore, this solution does not meet the requirement for controlled testing.

Learn more about canary deployment.


C
Use a linear deployment. In the LinearStepSize field, specify CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 10.

Incorrect. In a linear deployment, you gradually shift traffic from the old model version to the new model version in multiple steps. Setting LinearStepSize to CAPACITY_PERCENT with a value of 10 does not meet the requirement for immediate availability to all customers after validation. Linear deployments gradually increase traffic to the new version over time. Therefore, this configuration does not meet the requirement for immediate full rollout after the initial 10% validation. This solution would continue to incrementally add more customers to the new model. This solution would not meet the requirement for a quick switch to full deployment.

SageMaker Data Wrangler includes ML data transforms to featurize your dataset. You can define a repeatable data flow to clean, transform, and featurize your data. SageMaker Feature Store reduces repetitive efforts to transform raw data into features by providing centralized storage, discovery, and sharing of features and related metadata. The first step is to specify where to store the transformed data. You can configure the destination of the data flow as a feature group. Then, SageMaker Data Wrangler processing jobs will export features to the SageMaker Feature Store.

After specifying the feature group, the next step is to run the SageMaker Data Wrangler processing job. The job will transform raw data into the desired features based on the data flow that you created. After the data has been processed and ingested into the feature group, you can read the features from the offline SageMaker Feature Store. The offline store is optimized for batch processing. You can use the offline store to retrieve features for batch inference.

Creating a separate data pipeline to ingest the features is not necessary. The process of transforming and ingesting data into the feature store is already handled by the SageMaker Data Wrangler processing job. The online SageMaker Feature Store is intended for real-time uses cases where you need low-latency access to feature data. For batch inference, the offline SageMaker Feature Store is more appropriate.

Use a target tracking scaling policy to specify different instance types based on a predefined metric.

Incorrect. A target tracking scaling policy cannot change the instance type to a different instance type with more resources. Auto scaling policies increase or decrease the number of instances based on demand.

Learn more about how to define a scaling policy.


C
Use a schedule-based scaling policy to scale instance count at different times during the day.

Incorrect. A schedule-based scaling policy would not be the most suitable because the traffic increase is sporadic throughout the day. A schedule-based policy would not dynamically scale the resources based on the actual workload. Therefore, this solution could potentially lead to underutilization or overload of the system.

Learn more about auto scaling policies.


D
Use a step scaling policy to specify different instance types based on demand.

Incorrect. A step scaling policy cannot specify different instance types. Step scaling can add or remove instances. You can use scaling to increase or decrease the number of instances based on alarm metrics. However, target tracking scaling policies are more suitable to scale based on metrics such as average CPU utilization.

A company deployed into production an ML model to use for image classification. The company developed a new version of the model with improved precision. The company wants to deploy the new model into production. The company must test the new model alongside the old model by using the same data. Precision cannot be compromised. Some downtime can be tolerated.

Which deployment strategy will meet these requirements?

Report Content Errors

A
Blue/green deployment

Incorrect. Blue/green deployment provides two identical production environments. After testing finishes on the green environment, traffic is directed from the green environment to the blue environment. A blue/green deployment strategy does not test the new model alongside the old model by using the same data.

Learn more about blue/green deployment.


B
Canary deployment

Incorrect. Canary deployment would deploy the new model to a small group of users while other users continue to use the previous model. You can use canary deployment to test the new model alongside the old model. However, canary deployment does not perform inference on the same data. Additionally, this deployment strategy introduces risk because the system precision cannot be compromised.

Learn more about canary deployment.


C
A/B testing

Incorrect. An A/B testing strategy deploys changes to a model by directing a defined portion of traffic to the new model and directing the remaining traffic to the old model. This deployment strategy does not perform inference on the same data. Additionally, this strategy introduces risk because the system precision cannot be compromised.

Learn more about A/B testing.


D
Shadow testing

Correct. Shadow testing makes the new version of the model available alongside the old version. The input data runs through both versions. This strategy performs inference on the same data. This strategy ensures that the new model works as expected while minimizing risks.

A company deployed an ML model in Amazon SageMaker AI over 6 months ago. The model provides product recommendations. The model contributed to increased sales in the first quarter. In the most recent quarter, the number of customers purchasing the model's recommended products has been steadily declining.

Which solution can help improve the model’s effectiveness?

Report Content Errors

A
Re-train the model periodically with new and original data when a significant change in customer data is detected.

Correct. For a model to effectively make accurate predictions, you must re-train the model when you detect drift. Re-training the model when you detect significant changes in customer data can help the model adapt to new patterns and trends in customer behavior. You should use both new and existing data. You should re-train with new data because the new data contains patterns that were not present in the original data. Additionally, you should re-train with existing data because you do not want to lose patterns that were present in the original data. This solution can mitigate the impact of model drift and improve the model's performance over time.

B
Tune the hyperparameters periodically to reduce model drift.

Incorrect. You can use hyperparameter tuning to increase your productivity by trying many variations of the model before deployment. Hyperparameter tuning has no impact on the model after deployment.

Learn more about hyperparameter tuning.


C
Re-train the model periodically with only the original data. Apply regularization to improve prediction accuracy.

Incorrect. The model is already showing a decline in its effectiveness. Therefore, re-training the model on only the original data will not have a positive impact on the model's effectiveness. This solution will lead to overfitting. Overfitting is when the model performs well on the original data but does not perform well on new data.

Learn more about overfitting.


D
Train a new model with only new data. Use a different ML algorithm to handle model drift.

Incorrect. To train a new model and use a different ML algorithm takes significant time and resources. This level of effort is unnecessary because the model performed well in the first quarter. Additionally, training a new model only on new data can lead to losing valuable information that is contained in the original data. As the model ages over time and is presented with new data, the more effective solution is to re-train the model with original and new data.

A financial services company is migrating its data science environment to an Amazon SageMaker Studio domain. The data necessary for exploratory analysis is already stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. All network traffic must stay in the company's private network. The company must configure the SageMaker Studio domain and networking environment.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Select TWO.)

Report Content Errors

A
Create the SageMaker Studio domain in VPC only mode.

Correct. Creating a SageMaker Studio domain in VPC only mode prevents internet access to SageMaker Studio notebooks. In this case, SageMaker Studio communicates with other hosts and AWS services through a customer VPC and not through the internet. This step is necessary to ensure private connectivity.

Learn more about how to connect SageMaker Studio notebooks to VPC resources.


B
Create the SageMaker Studio domain with the EnableNetworkIsolation parameter set to True.

Incorrect. The EnableNetworkIsolation parameter prevents outbound communication in SageMaker AI training and inference containers. This parameter is not a valid configuration for SageMaker Studio.

C
Use a NAT gateway to run SageMaker Studio and to access the data in Amazon S3.

Incorrect. A NAT gateway can provide network access to other hosts and AWS services for SageMaker Studio in VPC only mode. However, the network traffic does not stay private in the VPC. Instead, you can use a NAT gateway to provide internet access to SageMaker Studio notebooks.

D
Use interface VPC endpoints to run SageMaker Studio and to access the data in Amazon S3.

Correct. Interface VPC endpoints allow SageMaker Studio to access other AWS services from a customer VPC without requiring internet access. You can use interface VPC endpoints to allow SageMaker Studio to access Amazon S3, the SageMaker runtime, and the SageMaker API.
