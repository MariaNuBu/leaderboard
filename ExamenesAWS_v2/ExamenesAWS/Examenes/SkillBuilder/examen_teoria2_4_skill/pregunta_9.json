        "Train the model on the entire dataset and use the same data to evaluate the model's performance.",
        "Train multiple complex models on the entire dataset, and use the average of their performances as the baseline.",
        "Start with a simple model, such as linear regression, and evaluate its performance on a held-out test dataset to establish the baseline.",
        "Split the dataset randomly into training and test sets and use the test set to establish the baseline performance."
