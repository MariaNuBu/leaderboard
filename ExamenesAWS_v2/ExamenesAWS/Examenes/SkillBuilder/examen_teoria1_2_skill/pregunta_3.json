      "question": "You are cleaning up a dataset that includes the body weights of patients at a medical clinic. A clinician tells you that they usually see adults, but children occasionally visit the clinic.\n\nWhich data measurement BEST provides the central tendencies of your data?",
      "options": [
        "You would choose the mean, because the best measurement of data that might contain outliers is taking the average of all data entries.",
        "You would choose the median, because the best measurement of data that might contain outliers is sorting the data and dividing the dataset at the middle variable.",
        "Because the data is numerical, you can use any method of measurement to find the average weight of a patient.",
        "There is no measurement you can use to find central tendencies of data."
