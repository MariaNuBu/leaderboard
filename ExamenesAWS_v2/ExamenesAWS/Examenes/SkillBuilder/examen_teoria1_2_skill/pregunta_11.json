      "question": "An aerospace engineering company is analyzing data from a recent rocket test flight. While reviewing the data, the analysts notice some duplicate timestamps for certain sensor readings and a few values that seem impossibly high or low.\n\nWhich option is the best approach for handling these data issues?",
      "options": [
        "Adjust the sensor calibration to avoid the duplicate and outlier values being recorded in the first place.",
        "Manually or systematically check the anomalous data points to determine if they are truly errors.",
        "Use one-hot encoding to locate and replace duplicated data points.",
        "Delete all data points that seem incorrect or duplicated without checking, because they are likely just errors."
