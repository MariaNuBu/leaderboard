      "question": "You are building a data repository for a beverage company. You are tasked with encoding the values of the various flavor combinations customers can choose when they create a custom beverage. There are hundreds of flavor options, so you have a lot of features in your dataset.\n\nWhich encoding technique is the BEST option for this encoding task?",
      "options": [
        "Any type of encoding technique will work in this situation.",
        "You would choose label encoding, because it assigns a unique integer for each flavor option.",
        "You would choose one-hot encoding, because it works most effectively when there are a lot of features in your dataset.",
        "Categorical encoding will not work for this machine learning solution."
