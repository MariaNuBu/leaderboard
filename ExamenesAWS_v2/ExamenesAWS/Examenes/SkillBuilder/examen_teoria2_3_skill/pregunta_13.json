      "options": [
        "Plot the model’s performance over time, and then look for significant decreases in performance on specific tasks after fine-tuning with new data.",
        "Re-train the model frequently on new data to make sure it doesn’t forget previously learned knowledge.",
        "Use a small validation set that only contains the most recent examples.",
        "Monitor the model’s loss function during training for any increases."
