      "question": "A machine learning engineer needs to train an ML model that can perform image generation. She works for a company that has a dog named Doppler as its mascot. She has decided to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion by Stability AI model so it can generate images of Doppler in various scenarios. The CEO of the company decides to add a second mascot, a cat named Mittens. So, the ML engineer needs the model to generate images of Mittens as well. What approach can be taken to add Mittens to the model?",
      "options": [
        "Choose a new model that is better suited for the task to eliminate the need for fine-tuning.",
        "Create a second model, trained on Mittens. Then, use transfer learning to combine the model trained on Doppler with the one trained on Mittens.",
        "Create a brand-new model and fine-tune it using both Doppler the dog and Mittens the cat as the custom dataset.",
        "Fine-tune the model using the output artifact from the original model trained with Doppler the dog."
