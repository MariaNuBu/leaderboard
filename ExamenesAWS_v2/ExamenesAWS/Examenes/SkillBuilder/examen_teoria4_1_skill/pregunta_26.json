      "question": "A machine learning engineer is tasked with monitoring the data quality of a machine learning model deployed for credit risk assessment. The model takes various financial and demographic features as input. \nWhich step should the engineer take to create a baseline dataset for monitoring data quality drift?",
      "options": [
        "Run a baseline processing job using the ModelQualityMonitor object in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, providing the training dataset stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).",
        "Use a third-party tool to analyze the training dataset and generate baseline statistics and constraints.",
        "Manually analyze the training dataset and create JSON files containing statistics and constraints based on your domain knowledge.",
        "Skip creating a baseline dataset and directly compare the incoming inference data against predefined thresholds."
