      "question": "A machine learning engineer is working on a project to monitor a deployed model that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. The model is currently in production and receiving real-time data from customer interactions. Which statement best describes the key aspects of effective model monitoring in this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Model monitoring is a one-time process that evaluates the model's performance after deployment and provides a report on its accuracy.",
        "Model monitoring involves continuously comparing the incoming data to a baseline dataset used for training, and detecting any deviations or anomalies in data quality or model performance.",
        "Model monitoring is a process that checks the model's code for errors and bugs, ensuring it is functioning correctly from a technical perspective.",
        "Model monitoring is a manual process where data scientists periodically review the model's predictions and compare them to actual customer behavior"
      ],
