      "question": "A machine learning engineer working on a fraud detection model for a financial institution. The model is currently deployed and receiving real-time transaction data for inference. To monitor the data quality of the incoming transactions, the engineer has set up Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor. Which steps should they take to create a baseline for data quality monitoring?",
      "options": [
        "Use the training dataset to generate baseline constraints and statistics using the suggest_baseline method of the ModelQualityMonitor object.",
        "Analyze the captured inference data from the deployed endpoint to generate baseline constraints and statistics.",
        "Use the validation dataset to generate baseline constraints and statistics using the suggest_baseline method of the ModelQualityMonitor object.",
        "Use a pre-defined set of default baseline constraints and statistics provided by SageMaker Model Monitor."
