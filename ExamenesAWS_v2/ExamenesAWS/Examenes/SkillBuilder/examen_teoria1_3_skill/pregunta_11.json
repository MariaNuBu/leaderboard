      "question": "You work as a machine learning engineer at a finance company, and you are building a machine learning model to predict loan default risk. You want to make sure you have a balanced and accurate dataset, and you want to split your data to test out the model.\n\nWhy is it important to split your data into training, testing, and validation data sets?",
      "options": [
        "Splitting the data allows you to train the model on data relationships, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate the model on distinct datasets.",
        "Splitting the data is a requirement for regulated financial models to ensure governance. The validation set proves to auditors that the model works.",
        "Splitting the data is important so that you can preserve some data for future models. The test set should be saved separately and not used for the model.",
        "Splitting the data is unnecessary. You can train and test the model on the full dataset."
