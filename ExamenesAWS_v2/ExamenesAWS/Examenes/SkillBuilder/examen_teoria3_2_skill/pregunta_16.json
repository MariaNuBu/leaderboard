      "question": "An MLOps engineer is planning for the deployment of an Amazon SageMaker endpoint for performing real-time inference. They need to choose an auto scaling policy and are considering a target tracking policy or a step scaling policy. What is a key difference between a target tracking scaling policy and a step scaling policy in SageMaker?",
      "options": [
        "A target tracking scaling policy is more complex to configure, whereas a step scaling policy is more straightforward.",
        "A target tracking scaling policy adjusts the number of instances to maintain a specific metric value. A step scaling policy adjusts the number of instances based on the size of the alarm breach.",
        "A target tracking scaling policy manages both scale out and scale in actions. A step scaling policy can only be used to scale out resources to meet increased demand.",
        "A target tracking scaling policy uses a predefined metric, whereas a step scaling policy uses a custom metric."
