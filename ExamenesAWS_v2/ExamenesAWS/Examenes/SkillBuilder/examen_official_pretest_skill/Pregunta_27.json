      "question": "TOPIC: 2.2 Train and refine models.\n\nA company is training a model on 50,000 images. A first evaluation of the model shows that the training error rapidly decreases as the number of epochs increases, which causes the model to generalize poorly on the evaluation data. A ML engineer must improve the generalization of the model.\n\nWhich method will meet the requirements?",
      "options": [
        "A\nDecrease the amount of images in the training dataset.",
        "B\nIncrease the amount of features in the training dataset.",
        "C\nIncrease the number for the regularization hyperparameter.",
        "D\nIncrease the number of epochs on the training data."
