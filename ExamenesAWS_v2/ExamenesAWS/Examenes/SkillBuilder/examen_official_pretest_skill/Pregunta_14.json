      "question": "An ML engineer uses Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to pre-process a housing dataset for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model. The dataset includes a Property_Age feature with values ranging from 1-10. The dataset also includes a Property_Price feature with most values around 300,000 and several outliers with values up to 15,000,000. The model requires features to be on a similar scale for optimal performance.\n\nWhich SageMaker Data Wrangler scaling function should be applied to the model?",
      "options": [
        "A\nStandard Scaler",
        "B\nRobust Scaler",
