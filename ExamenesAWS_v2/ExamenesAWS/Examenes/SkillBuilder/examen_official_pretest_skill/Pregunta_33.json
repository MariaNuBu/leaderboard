      "question": "TOPIC: 2.3 Analyze model performance\n\nAn ML engineer wants to use Amazon SageMaker to create a model that predicts whether a student will pass an exam. The ML engineer is developing a logistic regression model and needs to find an optimal model with the most accurate classification threshold. The ML engineer must select a model evaluation technique to analyze the performance of the model based on the defined threshold. The dataset contains an equal amount of observations for passed and failed exam attempts.\n\nWhich model evaluation technique meets the requirements?",
