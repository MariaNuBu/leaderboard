      "question": "TOPIC: 2.2 Train and refine models.\n\nA company deployed an ML model into production 6 months ago by using Amazon SageMaker Real-Time Inference. The company's website uses the real-time endpoint to provide product recommendations to customers. During the last 6 weeks, the effectiveness of the predictions has decreased and has resulted in lower sales.\n\nWhich solution can improve the product recommendations over time?",
      "options": [
        "Use the most recent data from only the last 2 weeks of sales to rebuild and train the model.",
        "Re-train the model periodically as the products that are offered change and the inventory changes. Use the original training data and adjust hyperparameters to account for product and inventory changes.",
        "Use SageMaker Ground Truth to automatically adjust the model to account for product and inventory changes.",
        "Re-train the model periodically as the products that are offered change and the inventory changes. Use the original training data and new training data."
