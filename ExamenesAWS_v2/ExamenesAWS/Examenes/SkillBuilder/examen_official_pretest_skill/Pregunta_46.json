      "question": "Official Pretest: AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer - Associate \nPREGUNTA 46\n\nTOPIC 3.3 Use automated orchestration tools to set up continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.\n\nAn ML engineer must maintain an existing Amazon SageMaker Pipelines pipeline to build an ML model. The ML engineer must modify the current pipeline to implement a custom model training logic. The training code is written in Python.\n\nWhich modification should the ML engineer make to meet these requirements?",
      "options": [
        "A\nWrap the custom training logic into a function and use the LambdaStep definition with the function name and script name as parameters. Add the LambdaStep definition to the current pipeline.",
        "B\nWrap the custom training logic into a function and use the TrainingStep definition with the function name and script name as parameters. Add the TrainingStep definition to the current pipeline.",
        "C\nWrap the custom training logic into a function and use the @remote decorator in the function. Add the function as a step in the current pipeline.",
        "D\nWrap the custom training logic into a function and use the @step decorator in the function. Add the function as a step in the current pipeline."
