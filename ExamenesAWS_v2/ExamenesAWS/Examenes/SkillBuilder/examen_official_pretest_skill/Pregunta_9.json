      "question": "TOPIC: 1.2 Transform data and perform feature engineering.\n\nAn ML engineer is developing a semantic segmentation computer vision product. The ML engineer has an unlabeled image dataset that is stored in Amazon S3. The images must be labeled to prepare the dataset to train a built-in classification ML model on Amazon SageMaker.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
      "options": [
        "A\nUse Amazon Rekognition custom labels.",
        "B\nUse a built-in SageMaker TensorFlow model.",
        "C\nCreate a SageMaker Ground Truth labeling job.",
        "D\nLabel the images by using an online labeling tool. Upload the labels to Amazon S3."
