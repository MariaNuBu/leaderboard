      "question": "A manufacturing organization is looking to build a machine learning lifecycle to predict the maintenance of factory machinery. This solution should help to increase quality control and optimize logistic efficiency by reducing downtime. The organization plans to store a large amount of data from which they will build a machine learning cluster for model training and inference. The organization would like to iterate over time on different versions of the model. This will require a storage requirement for various models with varying frequencies of use. What is NOT an appropriate storage solution for one of the machine learning lifecycle phases?",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon S3 for data collection, ingestion, and pre-processing for scalable and cost-effective large-scale storage.",
        "Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for model training. Using low-latency access and high IOPS performance storage using io2 EBS volumes for model training.",
        "Use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server to host the inference phase. Use Amazon FSx lifecycle policies to offload model copies and archival data.",
        "Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for model training. Concurrent access to a shared training data reduces the need for data replication."
