A company that provides a subscription-based service wants to implement a machine learning model that provides sentiment analysis to improve customer interactions. The company is collecting data from various data sources. One of these sources collects a userâ€™s comment, the number of likes on the comment, and time and date that the comment is posted. It also collects the user's profile statistics, such as age, name, and demographics. The data is collected in a comma separate value (CSV) format. Which data format changes could a data scientist make to improve performance?

Keep the data in a CSV format as row-based processing. This is already the most efficiently formatted data, and each attribute is important to sentiment analysis.

Include only the relevant columns, such as comments, likes, time, and date. Compress the data to reduce processing time and improve performance. (Correct)

Convert the data to an object notation format such as JSON because the hierarchical structure of JSON is more flexible than any other data format.

Keep the data in CSV format, but compress the data to reduce processing time and improve performance.

Use Amazon EMR with Apache Spark to process and combine data sources using the petabyte-scale capabilities of Amazon EMR.

Implement a real-time streaming pipeline using Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink to use SQL transformations to unify data formatting when output to Amazon S3.

Use AWS Glue to extract and combine data from the different database sources with Python or Scala scripts and copy the output to Amazon S3. (Correct)

Write Python scripts and deploy them using AWS Lambda. Run the scripts to access the data sources and write the combined data to Amazon S3.

An organization is in the process of deploying a machine learning system that ingests large amounts of streaming data from Amazon Kinesis to Amazon S3 for training. By using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, the organization finds that there is an increase in end-to-end latency and throughput is lower than needed. Which solution is most likely to improve ingestion performance?

Compress the data before sending it to Amazon Kinesis to improve bandwidth utilization.

Use multiple Amazon S3 buckets to stream the data to spreading the load across multiple Amazon S3 buckets.

Batch the data to improve ingestion efficiency because Amazon Kinesis can support batching. (Correct)

Increase Amazon S3 bucket capacity to avoid the storage destination from becoming a bottle neck.

You are working on a machine learning (ML) project that requires ingesting and processing large volumes of data from various sources. As the data is ingested with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and stored in Amazon S3, you have been experiencing performance issues. High latency, slow data transfer, and capacity limitations have all been occurring. How could you mitigate these issues?

You have insufficient monitoring and visibility into data transfer and storage systems. Set up Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Logs to monitor Amazon S3 and Amazon Data Firehose.

Uneven data distribution is causing hotspots and performance bottlenecks. Use batch data ingestion with Amazon Kinesis to improve data transfer efficiency and reduce the load on Amazon S3.

Scalability of the data ingestion portion of the pipeline is causing these issues (Amazon Data Firehose). Increase the amount of Amazon Kinesis shards and batch sizes to improve efficiency of Firehose.

Amazon S3 is running into capacity issues causing the low latency and data transfer slow down. Compress the data prior to transferring with dynamic partitioning to spread data across multiple Amazon S3 prefixes within an Amazon S3 bucket to avoid data hotspots. (Correct)
