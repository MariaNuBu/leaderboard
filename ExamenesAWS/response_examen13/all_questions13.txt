PREGUNTA 1
Case Study -
A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring.
The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3.
The company needs to use the central model registry to manage different versions of models in the application.
Which action will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create a separate Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository for each model.
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and unique tags for each model version.
C. Use the SageMaker Model Registry and model groups to catalog the models. Most Voted
D. Use the SageMaker Model Registry and unique tags for each model version.

A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring.
The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3.
The company must implement a manual approval-based workflow to ensure that only approved models can be deployed to production endpoints.
Which solution will meet this requirement?

A. Use SageMaker Experiments to facilitate the approval process during model registration.
B. Use SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking on the central model registry. Create tracking entities for the approval process.
C. Use SageMaker Model Monitor to evaluate the performance of the model and to manage the approval.
D. Use SageMaker Pipelines. When a model version is registered, use the AWS SDK to change the approval status to "Approved." Most Voted

HOTSPOT -
A company stores historical data in .csv files in Amazon S3. Only some of the rows and columns in the .csv files are populated. The columns are not labeled. An ML engineer needs to prepare and store the data so that the company can use the data to train ML models.
Select and order the correct steps from the following list to perform this task. Each step should be selected one time or not at all. (Select and order three.)
‚Ä¢ Create an Amazon SageMaker batch transform job for data cleaning and feature engineering.
‚Ä¢ Store the resulting data back in Amazon S3.
‚Ä¢ Use Amazon Athena to infer the schemas and available columns.
‚Ä¢ Use AWS Glue crawlers to infer the schemas and available columns.
‚Ä¢ Use AWS Glue DataBrew for data cleaning and feature engineering.

PREGUNTA 7
HOTSPOT -
A company wants to host an ML model on Amazon SageMaker. An ML engineer is configuring a continuous integration and continuous delivery (Cl/CD) pipeline in AWS CodePipeline to deploy the model. The pipeline must run automatically when new training data for the model is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.
Select and order the pipeline's correct steps from the following list. Each step should be selected one time or not at all. (Select and order three.)
‚Ä¢ An S3 event notification invokes the pipeline when new data is uploaded.
‚Ä¢ S3 Lifecycle rule invokes the pipeline when new data is uploaded.
‚Ä¢ SageMaker retrains the model by using the data in the S3 bucket.
‚Ä¢ The pipeline deploys the model to a SageMaker endpoint.
‚Ä¢ The pipeline deploys the model to SageMaker Model Registry.


Correct answer:

An S3 event notification invokes the pipeline when new data is uploaded.
SageMaker retrains the model by using the data in the S3 bucket
