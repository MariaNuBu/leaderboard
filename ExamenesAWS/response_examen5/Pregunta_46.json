      "question": "An e-commerce company needs to build a recommendation engine using a machine learning model trained on customer activity data, including purchase history, browsing patterns, and demographics. The team wants to streamline their model development process by creating a centralized repository of preprocessed features that can be reused across different projects. The system needs to support real-time recommendations and batch training.\n\nWhat is the MOST appropriate setup for the team to ensure consistent feature reuse, while also optimizing for real-time and batch processing?",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker Ground Truth to label the data and store the features in an offline store for training only.",
        "Use the SageMaker Feature Store to create an offline store for batch training and an online store for real-time inference.",
        "Use the SageMaker Feature Store to create an online store for batch processing and an offline store for real-time recommendations.",
        "Store all features in Amazon S3 and manually preprocess them for each model training run."
