      "question": "An ML engineer wants to build a sentiment analysis model using pre-built solutions in SageMaker JumpStart. They need a model that can quickly be deployed and then customized using their own dataset.\n\nWhat features of SageMaker JumpStart would be most useful for the ML engineer's needs?",
      "options": [
        "The ability to fine-tune foundation models with custom datasets and perform hyperparameter tuning.",
        "Only the use of prompt engineering to modify the inputs without needing to retrain the model.",
        "Pre-built solutions that automatically perform both data preprocessing and model training without user intervention.",
        "The option to use custom-built proprietary models with full infrastructure control."
