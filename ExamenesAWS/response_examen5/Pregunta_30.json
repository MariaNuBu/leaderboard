      "question": "You are a data scientist tasked with developing a model for a large e-commerce platform. The company needs a solution that minimizes development time and operational complexity. The team is considering using Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms instead of building custom models.\nWhich of the following advantages do built-in SageMaker algorithms offer for this use case? (Choose TWO)",
      "options": [
        "Built-in algorithms can only be used for simple tasks like linear regression and are not suitable for complex machine learning tasks.",
        "Built-in algorithms like XGBoost and Linear Learner abstract away infrastructure setup and allow quick model deployment.",
        "Pre-configured environments and infrastructure management are handled by AWS, eliminating the need for custom containers.",
        "Custom algorithms provide faster training times and more efficient resource usage compared to built-in algorithms.",
        "Custom frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow must be used with SageMaker to enable hyperparameter tuning."
