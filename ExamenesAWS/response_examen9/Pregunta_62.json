      "question": "A customer support system uses both Amazon Kendra for retrieving relevant support documents and Amazon Lex for handling voice and text interactions.

        "Use Amazon S3 Event Notifications to directly update the Kendra index and set up manual intents in Lex for ambiguous queries.",
        "Implement AWS CloudTrail to monitor the Kendra index and integrate it with Lexâ€™s natural language processing for ambiguous questions.",
        "Use Amazon EventBridge to trigger Lambda functions that update the Kendra index and implement Lex's fallback intent for handling ambiguous queries."
