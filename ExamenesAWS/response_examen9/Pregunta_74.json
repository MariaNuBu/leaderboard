      "question": "A data scientist wants to use one of Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms to solve a regression problem. They are considering the SageMaker Linear Learner algorithm because they need a straightforward, easy-to-deploy solution without managing custom infrastructure or creating their own containers. Which of the following steps are required to use SageMakerâ€™s built-in algorithms for this task? (Choose two.)",
      "options": [
        "Use a custom machine learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow to modify the algorithm.",
        "Select and define the hyperparameters for the algorithm.",
        "Manually configure the infrastructure for the training environment.",
        "Bring in the data and supply it to the SageMaker built-in algorithm.",
        "Set up and manage custom containers with the algorithm and hyperparameters."
      ],
      "correct_answers": [
        "Select and define the hyperparameters for the algorithm.",
