      "question": "A financial services company has tasked its ML team to analyze customer transaction data for enhancing its fraud detection system and identify potential customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns. The company has a dataset with multiple features, including transaction amounts, frequency, and location data.\n\nThe tasks are listed below, and the ML team must use Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms to complete these tasks:\n\nReduce the dimensionality of the dataset to improve model performance and visualization.\n\nPerform cluster analysis to identify distinct customer groups.\n\nDetect anomalous transactions that may indicate fraud.\n\nWhich combination of SageMaker built-in algorithms should the ML team use to meet the requirements?",
