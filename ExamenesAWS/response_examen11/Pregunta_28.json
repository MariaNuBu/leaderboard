      "question": "An ML engineer is developing a computer vision ML model to identify visual defects on the products. The engineer is using a dataset with 50,000 images of products that will be split for training and evaluation. During the validation step, the model is not accurately capturing the underlying relationship in the training dataset.\n\nWhich approach will improve the model performance?",
