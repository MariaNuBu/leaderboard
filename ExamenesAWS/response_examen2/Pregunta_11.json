      "question": "You are a data scientist at a financial services company tasked with deploying a lightweight machine learning model that predicts creditworthiness based on a customerâ€™s transaction history. The model needs to provide real-time predictions with minimal latency, and the traffic pattern is unpredictable, with occasional spikes during business hours. The company is cost-conscious and prefers a serverless architecture to minimize infrastructure management overhead.\n\nWhich approach is the MOST SUITABLE for deploying this solution, and why?",
      "options": [
        "Deploy the model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference, and configure AWS Lambda to preprocess incoming requests before sending them to the SageMaker endpoint for prediction",
        "Use an Amazon EC2 instance to host the model, with AWS Lambda functions handling the communication between the API Gateway and the EC2 instance for prediction requests",
        "Deploy the model directly within AWS Lambda as a function, and expose it through an API Gateway endpoint, allowing the function to scale automatically with traffic and provide real-time predictions",
        "Deploy the model using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and configure an AWS Lambda to trigger the ECS service on-demand, ensuring that the model is only running during peak traffic periods"
