      "question": "A healthcare company is automating the deployment of a machine learning solution to predict patient health risks. The ML engineer needs to use AWS CloudFormation to define a model that will be hosted on an Amazon SageMaker endpoint and serve real-time inference requests.\n\nWhich resource should the ML engineer create in the CloudFormation template to address this requirement?\n\nUse AWS::EC2::Instance to host the ML model manually and handle inference requests",

        "Use AWS::EC2::Instance to host the ML model manually and handle inference requests",
