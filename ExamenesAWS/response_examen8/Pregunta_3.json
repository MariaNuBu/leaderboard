      "options": [
        "SageMaker built-in algorithms require the use of custom containers where you manually install the necessary libraries.",
        "You need to bring your dataset and specify hyperparameters, but the algorithm is pre-packaged and managed by AWS, including the necessary infrastructure setup.",
        "The built-in algorithms come fully trained and do not require further training on your specific dataset, ensuring immediate deployment.",
        "SageMaker built-in algorithms cannot be used for image classification tasks, and custom algorithms must be used for these purposes."
