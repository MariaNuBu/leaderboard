      "question": "A machine learning engineer is using Amazon SageMaker Debugger to monitor a training job. The engineer notices that the modelâ€™s validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease. What action should the engineer take to address this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Increase the learning rate to improve the model's performance.",
        "Use early stopping to prevent further overfitting.",
        "Add more features to the model to increase its complexity.",
        "Reduce the amount of training data to prevent overfitting."
