      "question": "You are tasked with training a machine learning model for image classification using Amazon SageMaker's built-in algorithms.\nWhich of the following steps accurately describe the process of using SageMaker's built-in algorithms?\n\nSet up a custom container, upload the algorithm, and configure infrastructure.\n\nExplicaci√≥n\nThere is no need to set up a custom container or upload the algorithm for built-in algorithms since they are pre-packaged by AWS.",
      "options": [
        "Set up a custom container, upload the algorithm, and configure infrastructure.",
        "Select the algorithm from the SageMaker console, upload your dataset, configure hyperparameters, and launch the training job.",
        "Create a custom script for model training, manually configure hyperparameter tuning, and deploy the model on an EC2 instance.",
        "Use SageMaker built-in image generation algorithms and skip hyperparameter configuration to deploy a pre-trained model."
