      "question": "A machine learning team is using SageMaker Model Registry to manage the lifecycle of their models. After training a new version of a model, they want to automate the registration of the model in the registry and deploy it to a real-time endpoint. What features of SageMaker Model Registry and Pipelines will help achieve this?",
      "options": [
        "SageMaker Model Registry automatically deploys the model to a real-time endpoint without any further configuration.",
        "SageMaker Pipelines can automate the registration of the model in the registry and then trigger the deployment to a real-time endpoint based on predefined steps.",
        "Model versions in the registry cannot be automatically deployed; manual steps are always required.",
        "The team must manually register the model in the Model Registry and deploy it using the AWS Management Console."
