      "question": "A data scientist is tasked with monitoring feature attribution drift for a deployed model in SageMaker. What does feature attribution drift indicate?\n\nThe model's predictions differ from actual outcomes, affecting model quality.\n\nExplicación\nThis describes model quality drift, not feature attribution drift.\n\nThe input data no longer follows the distribution used during model training.\n\nExplicación\nThis describes data drift, not feature attribution drift.",
