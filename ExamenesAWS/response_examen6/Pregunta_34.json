      "question": "A company stores a large dataset in S3 that consists of multiple CSV files. They want to run queries on the data and visualize it using QuickSight. However, the dataset lacks a predefined schema.\n\nHow should the company set up the data infrastructure to meet these requirements?",

        "Use Glue ETL to transform the CSV data into a Parquet format, store the schema in the Glue Data Catalog, and use Athena to query the data.",
        "Use Redshift Spectrum to read the CSV files from S3 and manually create a schema for Redshift to query the data.",
        "Use Glue ETL to convert CSV files into JSON format, create a schema in Glue Data Catalog, and then import data into Redshift for querying."
