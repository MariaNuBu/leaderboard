      "question": "A financial services firm is building a fraud detection system and is considering whether to use custom models or built-in algorithms in Amazon SageMaker. In which scenario would a custom algorithm be MORE appropriate than a built-in algorithm?\n\nWhen the task requires basic machine learning models like Linear Learner or XGBoost.\nWhen you need to use proprietary machine learning models that are not available as built-in algorithms in SageMaker.\nWhen your goal is to minimize infrastructure management and focus only on tuning hyperparameters.\nWhen built-in algorithms in SageMaker are optimized for the task at hand, such as fraud detection.",
