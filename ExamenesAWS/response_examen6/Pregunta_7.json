      "question": "A company is training a deep learning model with billions of parameters, which is too large to fit on a single machine. They decide to use model parallelism on Amazon SageMaker.\nWhat key feature of SageMaker makes model parallelism easier to implement, and how does it work?",
      "options": [
        "SageMaker Model Monitor automatically manages and optimizes the model splitting process across multiple GPUs.",
        "SageMaker handles model parallelism by dividing the dataset across multiple machines and averaging the model gradients.",
        "SageMaker’s Model Parallelism Library automatically splits the model across multiple GPUs or machines, based on the model architecture and available memory.",
        "SageMaker’s built-in algorithms dynamically adjust the batch size to ensure the model can be trained on multiple machines."
