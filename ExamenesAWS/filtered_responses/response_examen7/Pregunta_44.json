      "question": "A machine learning engineer is building a model to predict rare diseases based on a dataset where the majority of patients do not have the disease. To handle the imbalance in the dataset, the engineer is considering using SageMaker Data Wrangler to preprocess the data.\n\nWhich technique provided by SageMaker Data Wrangler is the BEST option to address class imbalance without increasing the risk of overfitting?\n\nRandom undersampling to reduce the number of samples in the majority class.\n\nExplicaci√≥n\nWhile undersampling can address class imbalance, it risks losing important information from the majority class, which could negatively impact model performance.",
