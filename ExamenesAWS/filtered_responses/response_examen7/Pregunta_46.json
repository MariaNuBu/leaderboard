      "question": "A machine learning team needs to regularly transform and load large datasets from Amazon S3 into a data warehouse for model training. They are considering using AWS Glue for this ETL process but want to ensure the process is scalable, cost-efficient, and able to handle incremental updates. Which features of AWS Glue should they leverage to meet these requirements? (Choose Two)\n\nPre-configure fixed Spark cluster resources to avoid unexpected scaling charges.\n\nUse AWS Glue crawlers to infer the schema and classify the data in real-time, ensuring all new files are processed immediately.\n\nUtilize AWS Glue’s serverless architecture and auto-scaling capabilities to manage Spark clusters automatically, ensuring scalability.\n\nUse AWS Glue to configure incremental ETL jobs that only process new or modified data.\n\nUse AWS Glue’s built-in scheduling to trigger ETL jobs at regular intervals and process the entire dataset each time for consistency.",
