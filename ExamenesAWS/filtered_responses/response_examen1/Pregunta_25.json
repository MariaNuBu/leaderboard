      "question": "A manufacturing company is building an anomaly detection system to identify defective products in its production lines. The datasets include sensor logs from IoT devices stored in Amazon S3 and a list of production metadata from an on-premises SQL database.\n\nThe company must:\n\nAggregate and preprocess the data from multiple sources.\n\nImplement a solution to detect anomalies automatically in the sensor data.\n\nVisualize the results for analysis by the operations team.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements most efficiently?",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to aggregate, clean, and prepare data for anomaly detection while generating visual insights",
        "Use Amazon Athena to query the sensor data and identify anomalies through SQL queries. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results",
        "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to process and analyze the sensor data in real time for anomaly detection. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize the results",
        "Use Amazon EMR with Spark MLlib to run anomaly detection algorithms and visualize the results using custom dashboards"
