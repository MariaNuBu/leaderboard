      "question": "Topic: MLA – Deployment and Orchestration of ML Workflows\n\nA data scientist is working for a company that specializes in developing machine learning models for large-scale video processing tasks. The current project involves training a deep-learning model using a massive dataset of high-resolution videos. The dataset is stored in a distributed file system, and the training process requires high throughput and low latency access to the data. Additionally, the training process involves frequent read and write operations, and the storage solution must be able to handle the high I/O demands efficiently.\n\nWhich of the following storage services will meet the requirements?\n\nAmazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)\nAWS Storage Gateway\nAmazon File Cache\nAmazon FSx for Lustre",
