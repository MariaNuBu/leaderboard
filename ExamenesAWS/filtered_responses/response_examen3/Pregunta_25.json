      "question": "A global news agency operates a document retrieval system that helps journalists find relevant articles using natural language queries. The existing system uses a vector database for storing embeddings of news articles. The agency has migrated all its archived articles to an Amazon S3 bucket and now needs a solution on AWS to provide semantic search capabilities for these articles.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements most efficiently?",
      "options": [
        "Use Amazon Kendra to index the archived articles in the S3 bucket and enable semantic search with natural language queries",
        "Use Amazon Comprehend to extract key phrases and entities from the articles and build a custom search engine for semantic retrieval",
        "Leverage AWS Glue to preprocess the archived articles and create a metadata catalog, then use Athena to perform semantic queries on the catalog",
        "Deploy a SageMaker endpoint with a fine-tuned language model to process user queries and manually integrate the model with S3 for retrieving articles"
