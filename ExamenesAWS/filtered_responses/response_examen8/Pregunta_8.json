      "question": "A startup working on autonomous driving technology needs to label a large dataset of road images for training their object detection model.\nThe team wants to minimize the cost of labeling while maintaining high-quality results.\nThey aim to use a combination of human labelers and automation to label straightforward objects while having human reviewers handle more complex cases.\n\nWhich of the following strategies BEST fits their needs?",
      "options": [
        "Use SageMaker Ground Truth with active learning to automate labeling of simple cases while sending complex cases to human labelers for review.",
        "Use SageMaker Feature Store to preprocess and label the images before passing them to the machine learning model for training.",
        "Use a fully automated labeling approach without human intervention to reduce labeling costs.",
        "Use SageMaker Experiments to run multiple trials of different labeling approaches to determine which strategy reduces costs the most."
