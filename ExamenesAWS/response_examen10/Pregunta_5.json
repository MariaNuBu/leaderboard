      "question": "An ML engineer is developing a model that detects fraudulent transactions. Despite the model having good overall accuracy with non-fraudulent cases and a small dataset, there are false negatives because of a low number of recorded fraudulent activities. The ML engineer wants to improve the performance of the model.\n\nWhich solution will meet this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "A\nApply random oversampling on the non-fraudulent transactions.",
        "B\nApply undersampling on all transaction cases.",
        "C\nDuplicate the entire training dataset and shuffle both datasets.",
        "D\nApply Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) on the fraudulent transactions."
